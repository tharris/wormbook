# Virtual Hosts
#
# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# Use name-based virtual hosting.
#

NameVirtualHost *:80
#NameVirtualHost *:8080
#NameVirtualHost *:8081

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#

#<VirtualHost *:80>
##   ServerName	    www.wormbase.org
##   ServerAlias      wormbase.org
#   ServerName       brie6.cshl.edu
#   ServerAlias      brie6.cshl.org
#   UseCanonicalName On
#   RewriteEngine ON
#   RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ http://www.wormbase.org/$1 [R=301,L]
#</VirtualHost>


# To actually serve files for WormBase from brie6:
