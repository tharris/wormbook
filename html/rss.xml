<description>Tristan Fiedler, who led the software development group at WormBook, has left WormBook. He has taken a faculty position at the Florida Institute of Technology. Tristan guided the development of every aspect of the web site. He developed the methods to convert manuscripts to web-ready articles; he designed the initial layout of the web site; and he generated the programs to search WormBook, download reference citations, and provide feedback. His input on all aspects of WormBook will be missed.

<description>WormBook Editor Lisa Girard has moved to a position at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.  Lisa guided WormBook from its beginning, and her creativity, dedication, and efficiency were essential for its success.  Lisa was involved in all aspects of WormBook production: she prodded authors, reviewers, and editorial board members to keep WormBook on schedule, edited and oversaw the publication of 140 articles on the web, and successfully negotiated WormBook's inclusion on the NIH Bookshelf and in PubMed. Lisa leaves WormBook in excellent shape.  We wish her continued success in her new position.
