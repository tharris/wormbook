WormBook Editor Lisa Girard has moved to a position at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.  Lisa guided WormBook from its beginning, and her creativity, dedication, and efficiency were essential for its success.  Lisa was involved in all aspects of WormBook production: she prodded authors, reviewers, and editorial board members to keep WormBook on schedule, edited and oversaw the publication of 140 chapters on the web, and successfully negotiated WormBook's inclusion on the NIH Bookshelf and in PubMed. Lisa leaves WormBook in excellent shape.  We wish her continued success in her new position.

<br />
WormBook has recently added "Heterologous expression of <em>C. elegans</em> ion channels in <em>Xenopus</em> oocytes" to the Neurophysiological methods section of WormMethods. Additionally, two new <em>Pris
tionchus pacificus</em> chapters have been published: "<em>Pristionchus pacificus</em> genomics: from genetics to genome sequence" in WormMethods and "<em>Pristionchus pacificus</em>" in the Genetics and ge
nomics section of WormBook, launching our new subsection "Biology and genome of nematodes other than <em>C. elegans</em>".
</p>

<p><b>July 31, 2006<br /><br />New WormBook Chapters and WormMethods Sections</b>
<br />
There were several new additions to WormBook's WormMethods section in July including "Behavior", "Immunohistochemistry", "Protocols for large scale in situ hybridization on C. elegans larvae", and a new methods section containing methods and protocols for nematode species other than C. elegans. This section currently has two chapters, "Pristionchus pacificus genetic protocols" and "Isolation of C. elegans and related nematodes", with more to be added soon. The Neurobiology and behavior section of WormBook has also expanded this month with the publication of "Male mating behavior".
