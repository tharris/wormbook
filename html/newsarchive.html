        <p><b>February 22 2016<br /><br />Robert Stuart (Bob) Edgar, 1930-2016</b>
	<br />
We join the worm community in mourning Bob Edgar who died peacefully at home February 1.  Bob helped establish <em>C. elegans</em> as a model organism and was an enthusiastic promoter of collegial nature of our field.  Bob started The Worm Breeder's Gazette in 1975, and WormBook is proud to carry on his legacy. His full obituary can be read at <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/02/edgar-in-memoriam.html"  target="_blank">http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/02/edgar-in-memoriam.html</a>.
