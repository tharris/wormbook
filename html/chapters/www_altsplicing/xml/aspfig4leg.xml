        <para>(A) Alternative splicing of the <emphasis>let-2</emphasis> gene containing mutually exclusive exons 9 and 10. The intron downstream of exon 10 begins with a GC dinucleotide important for splicing regulation. (B) Diagram of alternative splicing of the <emphasis>unc-52</emphasis> gene. Every combination of exon inclusion and skipping of exons 16, 17 and 18 has been detected. MEC-8 enhances the splicing of two of the isoforms, 15-19 and 15-16-19, indicated in red (<link linkend="bib77">Lundquist et al., 1996<!-- :PMID 8625846 --></link>).</para>
