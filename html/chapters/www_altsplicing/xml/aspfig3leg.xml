        <title>Figure 3. Examples of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> alternatively spliced genes</title>
        <para>Images are screen shots taken from the Wormbase genome browser. (A) <emphasis>unc-32</emphasis>. The three alternative exon 4s and two alternative exon 7s are indicated. (B) <emphasis>cha-1</emphasis> and <emphasis>unc-17</emphasis> share a common promoter and 5' untranslated exon. (C) <emphasis>egl-15</emphasis>. The two mutually exclusive exons, 5A and 5B, which provide functional specificity, are indicated, as are the five different 3' ends generated by alternative splicing. Both exon 5 isoforms have been detected with each of the 3' end isoforms, so there are 10 alternatively spliced isoforms of this gene (<link linkend="bib73">Goodman et al., 2003<!-- :PMID 12835392 --></link>).Only five of the isoforms are indicated in the graphic.
