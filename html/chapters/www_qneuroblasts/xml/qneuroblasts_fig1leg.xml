<title>Figure 1. Q cell lineage and schematic overview of their migration.</title>
<para>(A) Both Q neuroblasts undergo an identical pattern of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions generating two cells that undergo apoptosis (Q.aa and Q.pp) and three cells that after completing their migration differentiate into specific sensory neurons and interneurons. (B) At the time of hatching (0 h) both Q neuroblasts are located within the two lateral rows of seam cells (V1-V6) at a position located between V4 and V5. During L1 development the Q cell on the right lateral side (<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=QR;class=Cell" role="_blank">QR</ulink>) will migrate anteriorly while the left Q cell (<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=QL;class=Cell" role="_blank">QL</ulink>) migrates posteriorly. After approximately 4 h, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=QL;class=Cell" role="_blank">QL</ulink> is positioned above V5 while <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=QR;class=Cell" role="_blank">QR</ulink> lies above V4. This initial short range migration is followed by the first cell division (4-5 h). The Q descendants (Q.x) migrate further along the anteroposterior axis.  During their long range migration, Q.a and Q.p undergo one and two additional cell divisions, respectively. Different cells in the Q lineage migrate with different velocities. Values in B indicate migration speed in &mu;m/h (<link linkend="bib50">Ou and Vale, 2009</link>).<!--: PMID 19349580--> At the end of L1, three QL.x and three QR.x occupy well-defined final positions and differentiate into neurons. Body axes are as indicated.</para>
