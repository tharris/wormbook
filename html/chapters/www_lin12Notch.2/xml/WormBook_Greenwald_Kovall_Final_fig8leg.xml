<title>Figure 8. Structure of dimeric human CSL-NICD-MAM ternary complexes bound to HES-1 DNA.</title>
<para>Figure shows two CSL-NICD-MAM ternary complexes bound to the HES-1 SPS for Notch components from humans. CSL, NICD, and MAM are colored green, blue, and red, respectively. The DNA is colored grey. A magenta asterisk denotes the site of cooperative interactions between the ANK domains of NICD.</para>
