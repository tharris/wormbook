<title>Figure 8. Various effects of Wnt signaling on the nervous system.</title>
<para>Schematic representations of the nervous system and its defects in Wnt mutants. Blue, green, and light blue lines represent axons, dendrites, and neurites, respectively. Arrowheads in G indicate a neurite eliminated during larval development. This process is accelerated in <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=cwn-2;class=Gene" role="_blank">cwn-2</ulink></emphasis> mutants. Purple and brown circles in H and I represent synapses and acetylcholine-gated ion channels, respectively. VNC stands for ventral nerve cord. Wnt expressions are roughly shown in yellow (See text for details). The effects of Wnts are instructive for neurons (magenta cell bodies) or permissive for neurons (orange cell bodies). Left and right panels represent wild type and Wnt mutants, respectively, except for G and H. In G, the left and right panels represent L1 and adult wild-type animals. In H, the left, middle, and right panels represent wild type, <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=lin-44;class=Gene" role="_blank">lin-44</ulink>,</emphasis> and <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=lin-44;class=Gene" role="_blank">lin-44</ulink>; <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=egl-20;class=Gene" role="_blank">egl-20</ulink></emphasis> mutants, respectively. Panel I represents a much higher magnification compared to the other panels.</para>
