<para>(A) Spreading mixture of worms/egg/<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=HB101;class=Strain" role="_blank">HB101</ulink> across surface of 15 cm NGM-lite plate. (B) Plate ready to harvest for bombardment. After spreading, grown for 4 days at 20&deg;C. Note that worms are found mostly in large piles with remaining food.  The majority of the animals are gravid adults. (C) Vortexing gold particles at low speed using foam tube holder insert.  A vortexer with such an insert is required equipment for the long vortexing steps associated with precipitation of DNA onto the gold particles.</para>
