<title>Figure 2. Worms ready to bombard.</title>
<para>(A) Approximately 3 ml of packed worms coating the surface of a chilled 10 cm NGM-lite plate (<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=HB101;class=Strain" role="_blank">HB101</ulink> seeded). A confluent layer of worms completely coats the surface of the plate. Chilling the plate stops worm movement that creates gaps in the coverage. Plastic wrap covering the ice reduces contamination of the worms with bacterial and fungal microbes. (B) Confluent worm plate in bombardment chamber.  The plate is attached to the shelf using at least five pieces of rolled up lab tape. Note position relative to pressure divider and macrocarrier holder components of Hepta adapter.</para>
