        <title>Figure 3. Bouin's tube fixation for muscle preservation</title>
        <para>(A) Actin was labeled in a wild-type L2 larva fixed using <link linkend="sec2_8">Protocol 8: Bouin's tube fixation</link> with 1 hour in Bouin's fixative with methanol and <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x003B2;</symbol>-mercaptoethanol, followed by incubation in Borate Tris buffers. Staining was using <link linkend="sec2_14">Protocol 14: Staining tube-fixed worms</link> with mouse anti-actin (Chemicon monoclonal C4), followed by Oregon Green 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse. (B) Talin was labeled in a wild-type embryo with rabbit B547 anti-talin (gift of Bob Barstead and Gary Moulder) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit. (C) Double staining of talin, stained with rabbit B547, and vinculin, stained with monoclonal antibody MH24 (gift of Russ Francis) in a wild-type adult. Secondary antibodies were Oregon Green 488 donkey anti-rabbit and Cy3 donkey anti-mouse.
