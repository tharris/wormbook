<formalpara><title>Figure 4: <emphasis>att</emphasis>B sites in final constructs</title><para/></formalpara>
<formalpara><title/><para>A. The frame usage of <emphasis>att</emphasis>B sites must be considered for final constructs. These reading frames are suggested by Invitrogen and are used for all clones listed in Table 1. Extra nucleotides flanking the <emphasis>att</emphasis>B sites (in red) must be added for proper reading frame usage.</para></formalpara>
<formalpara><title/><para>B. Example of a construct with the start codon in the 5&#x0027; cassette and a stop codon in the 3&#x0027; cassette. In the 5&#x0027; cassette (containing a promoter) an A (in red) is added after the ATG so that the <emphasis>att</emphasis>B1 sequences will be in frame. In the middle cassette (containing GFP) CA (in red) is added 5&#x0027; of the GFP coding sequence and an A (in red) is added after the final GFP codon to maintain frame through the attB2 site. In the 3&#x0027; cassette (containing ORF::3&#x0027;UTR) GA (in red) is added before the ORF coding sequence to maintain frame through the ORF. In this strategy, an available promoter can be used in the 5&#x0027; cassette (Table 1A) and an available fluorescent tag can be used in the middle cassette (Table 1B). The 3&#x0027; cassette containing ORF::3&#x0027;UTR is the only entry clone that needs to be created by the researcher. We typically clone the ORF::3&#x0027;UTR (with introns) directly from a genomic DNA template, but a cDNA template can also be used.</para></formalpara>
<formalpara><title/><para>C. Example of a construct with the start codon and stop codon in the middle cassette. This strategy avoids the inclusion of attB sequences in the final ORF. Available promoters (lacking ATG) (Table 1A) and 3&#x0027;UTRs (Table 1C) can be used in the 5&#x0027; and 3&#x0027; cassettes. The middle cassette must contain the ORF and fluorescent tag fused by fusion PCR.</para></formalpara>
