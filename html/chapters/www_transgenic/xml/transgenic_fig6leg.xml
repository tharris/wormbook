<formalpara><title/><para>A. Most BP reactions yield the desired Entry clone with insert. Empty pDONR plasmids resulting from an internal recombination reaction are obtained at a low frequency (C.M. unpublished) and are usually rare enough not to be a problem. Empty pDONRs can, however, become a nuisance (be more common) if the BP is performed with very small amounts of PCR insert or with a very long PCR insert (&#x223C;6 kb or greater).</para></formalpara>
<formalpara><title/><para>B. To help screen out empty pDONRs, DNA from a transformed colony is run directly on a gel to verify that the approximate size plasmid is present (for protocol see: &#x201C;Rapid Screening by Direct Electrophoresis&#x201D; section in Chapter 19 of <ulink url="http://www.springerprotocols.com/BookToc/doi/10.1385/1592594093?uri=/Full/doi/10.1385/1-59259-409-3:169">E. coli Plasmid Vectors: Methods and Applications</ulink>). Minipreps are then performed only on those colonies that contain the larger super-coiled plasmids. In this specific example, the BP reaction was done with a very low quantity (&#x003C;15 ng) of a 4 kb PCR product. The colony on the far left contains the pDONR vector with the 4kb insert, while the next 6 colonies are all empty pDONRs.</para></formalpara>
