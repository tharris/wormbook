         <title>Figure 7. Model of sarcomere development showing several adjacent cells in one dorsal muscle quadrant at several successive developmental stages</title>
	<para>Developmental stage is indicated by the extent of elongation in embryo cartoons at the top.  Wild-type (A-D) and <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=spc-1" role="_blank">spc-1</ulink></emphasis> mutant embryos (E, F) are shown.  In panels A-F, muscle cells (<emphasis>white</emphasis>) are shown on top of the basal lamina (<emphasis>light green</emphasis>) and the basal face of the hypodermis (<emphasis>shaded gray</emphasis>).  The bottom of panels B-D show enlarged views of developing muscle attachments (black dots), with the position of hypodermal circumferential actin cables indicated (<emphasis>black horizontal red lines</emphasis>). G shows a hypothetical linkage between muscle attachments and hypodermal actin cables involving a "linker protein" bound to <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/protein?name=UNC-52;class=protein" role="_blank">UNC-52</ulink>/perlecan, which in turn binds integrin.  Note that direct binding between integrin and <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/protein?name=UNC-52;class=protein" role="_blank">UNC-52</ulink> has not been demonstrated in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, although integrin-perlecan binding has been demonstrated in vertebrates.
