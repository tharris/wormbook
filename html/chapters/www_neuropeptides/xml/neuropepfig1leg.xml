		<title>Figure 1. Processing of a neuropeptide gene product: <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=flp-1;class=Gene" role="_blank">flp-1</ulink></emphasis> as an example.</title>
		<para>After translation of the <emphasis>flp-1A</emphasis> transcript, pre-pro-FLP-1A is cleaved by signal peptidase in the endoplasmic reticulum to release the signal peptide. The propeptide pro-FLP-1A is further cleaved C-terminal to mono-, di-, or tribasic residues (indicated by K and R) by proprotein convertases, such as <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=EGL-3;class=Protein" role="_blank">EGL-3</ulink>/<ulink url="http://wormbase.org/db/get?name=KPC-2;class=Protein" role="_blank">KPC-2</ulink>. The basic amino acids are removed by carboxypeptidases E, such as <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=EGL-21;class=Protein" role="_blank">EGL-21</ulink>, to yield the basic neuropeptides. The FLP-1A peptides are further modified by the addition of an amide group donated from the C-terminal glycine, a reaction which may be catalyzed by <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=T19B4.1;class=Gene" role="_blank">T19B4.1</ulink>, to yield the active peptides. After release, peptides are removed from the synaptic cleft by proteolytic degradation, which may be mediated by <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=NEP-1;class=Protein" role="_blank">NEP-1</ulink>. With the exception of PNFMRFYamide, all <emphasis>flp-1A</emphasis> encoded peptides have been biochemically isolated (<link linkend="bib55">Li, 2005</link>).</para>
