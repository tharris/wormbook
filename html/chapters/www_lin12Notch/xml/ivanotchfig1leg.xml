         <para>Conserved motifs: EGF <symbol  role="symbolfont">&#x003D;</symbol> epidermal growth factor-like motif, LNR <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x003D;</symbol> LIN-12/Notch repeat motif, CDC10/Ank <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x003D;</symbol> a motif found in yeast CDC10, SWI6, and Ankyrin. There are two <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> LIN-12/Notch proteins, LIN-12 and GLP-1; both have the same arrangement of motifs, as represented by the single cartoon. Inferred cleavage sites are shown (see also Figure 2). There are ten predicted DSL proteins; representative transmembrane and secreted DSL proteins are shown. All ten DSL proteins have a single amino-terminal DSL domain, followed by one or more EGF motifs.</para>
