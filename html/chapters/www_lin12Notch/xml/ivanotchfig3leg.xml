         <para>A. The LIN-12/Notch activation complex. The intracellular domain of LIN-12 or GLP-1 forms a ternary complex with LAG-1 and SEL-8, which are both essential for <emphasis>lin-12</emphasis> and <emphasis>glp-1</emphasis> activity (Lambie and Kimble, 1991; Tax et al.,1997; Doyle et al., 2000; Petcherski and Kimble, 2000). B. The SEL-12/Presenilin (<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x03B3;</symbol>-secretase) complex. SEL-12 and HOP-1, the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> Presenilins (PS), adopt an eight transmembrane domain topology and are cleaved into N-terminal (PS NTF) and C-terminal (PS CTF) fragments. Transmembrane domains 6 and 7 contain catalytic aspartyl residues (represented by shading). The contributions of the two-pass transmembrane protein PEN-2, the seven-pass transmembrane protein APH-1, and the single-pass transmembrane protein APH-2/Nicastrin are described in the text. </para>
