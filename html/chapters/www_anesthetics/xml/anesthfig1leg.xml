		<para>The concentrations of anesthetic necessary to cause immobility are higher in the nematode than in humans. Note, also, the relative positions of anesthetic endpoints in humans compared to the relative positions for endpoints in the nematode. It is not known which endpoints in the nematode correspond to specific endpoints in humans.</para>
