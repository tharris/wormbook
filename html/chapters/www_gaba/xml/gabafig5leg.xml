        <title>Figure 5. AVL and DVB motor neurons stimulate enteric muscles</title>
        <para>(A) Schematic diagram of the defecation motor program (Thomas, 1990<!-- ; PMID 15219740 -->). Every 50s an animal initiates a defecation cycle, which consists of the three stereotyped independent muscle contractions. The cycle begins with the posterior body contraction (pBoc), followed by the anterior body contraction (aBoc), and concluded by the enteric muscle contraction (Emc). Contracting muscles are indicated by dark shading. (B) Schematic of the enteric muscles. The enteric muscles consist of four cells: the anal depressor, sphincter, and two bilaterally-symmetric intestinal cells. These cells are gap-junctioned to one another, and each cell sends a muscle arm to the preanal ganglion where DVB makes synaptic contact. AVL, which is located anteriorly in the ventral head ganglion, sends a process along the ventral nerve cord abutting DVB and the enteric muscles. Release of GABA from AVL and DVB causes the anal depressor and intestinal muscles to contract. Reprinted from <link linkend="bib51">Schuske et al.
