        <title>Figure 3. The D-type motor neurons inhibit body muscles</title>
        <para>(A) When a wild-type worm is tapped on the nose it moves backwards by propagating a sinusoidal wave from the tail to the head. (B) When a mutant defective for GABA transmission is tapped on the nose, it contracts muscles on both sides of its body causing the animal to shrink. Scale 0.5 mm. (Photo courtesy of J. White). (C) Motor neuron connectivity. Motor neuron cell bodies are in the ventral cord. The DD and VD GABA neurons (blue) synapse to the dorsal and ventral body muscles, respectively. Cholinergic motor neurons (red) send inputs to the ventral and dorsal body muscles, as well as the GABA motor neurons. Release of acetylcholine leads to contraction of the body wall muscle on one side and stimulates GABA release onto muscles on the opposite side. This stimulation and contralateral inhibition causes the body to bend and leads to coordinated locomotion. Excitatory inputs are indicated by dark shading.
