        <para>(A) GABA is synthesized from glutamate by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). (B) GABA drugs. Muscimol is a GABA<subscript>A</subscript> agonist and baclofen is a GABA<subscript>B</subscript> agonist. Bicuculline and saclofen are antagonists of GABA<subscript>A</subscript> and GABA<subscript>B</subscript>respectively. Invertebrate GABA<subscript>A</subscript>-like receptors are insensitive to bicuculline.</para>
