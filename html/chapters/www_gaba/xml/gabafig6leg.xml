    <title>Figure 6. Genes required for GABA function in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis></title>
    <para>GABA is synthesized in the cytoplasm of the neuron by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) encoded by the <emphasis>unc-25</emphasis> gene. GABA is then transported into the synaptic vesicle by the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) encoded by the <emphasis>unc-47</emphasis> gene. The UNC-46 protein is likely to be an accessory protein in vesicular GABA transport. The UNC-30 transcription factor is required for GAD and VGAT expression in the GABA motor neurons. GABA released from the DD and VD motor neurons activates the inhibitory GABA<subscript>A</subscript>-like UNC-49 receptor; the influx of chloride ions causes the relaxation of the body muscles. GABA release from the AVL and DVB motor neurons activates the novel excitatory EXP-1 receptor; the influx of sodium ions causes the contraction of the enteric muscles GABA is cleared from the cleft by the plasma membrane transporter, SNF-11.
