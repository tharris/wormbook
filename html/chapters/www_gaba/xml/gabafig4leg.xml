        <title>Figure 4. The RME motor neurons inhibit foraging movements</title>
        <para>(A) Wild-type worms wave their heads in a narrow arc while foraging. (B) Mutants that lack GABA curve their heads in exaggerated flexures when foraging. (C) RMED motor neuron connectivity (White et al., 1986<!-- ; PMID 15219740 -->). The long undifferentiated processes of SAA and SMB may contain stretch receptors that are activated by positive curvature. These could stimulate the RME neuron which releases GABA onto the contralateral side to relax the flexed muscles. The RMED and RMEV neurons also have processes extending into the dorsal and ventral nerve cords, respectively. In addition, the dorsal and ventral RMEs receive input from the mechanosensory neurons IL1 and IL2, and the lateral RMEs receive input from the mechanosensory neurons OLQ and OLL, which could cause the head to move away from a stimulus by causing the muscles to relax on the touched side. Open arrows, stretch input; horizontal lines, gap junctions; solid arrows, chemical synapses. Excitatory inputs are indicated by dark shading in the muscle, inhibitory inputs are shown as white areas.</para>
