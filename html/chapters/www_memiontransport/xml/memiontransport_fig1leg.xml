<para>Every ~ 50 s, three independent sets of muscle contractions are carried out in a stereotypical sequence. The first step consists of <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0001641;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">pBoc</ulink>, a simultaneous contraction of the posterior body wall muscles on both sides of the worm. This step compresses the lumen in the posterior of the worm and moves the luminal contents forward. The second step, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000204;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">aBoc</ulink>, occurs several seconds later and consists of a contraction of the anterior body wall muscles. This causes the terminal bulb of the pharynx to plunge into the anterior-most, bowl-like region of the intestinal lumen and results in the luminal contents moving backwards. Expulsion is then carried out by four coordinated enteric muscle contractions (emc; not shown in detail). Blue, intestine; orange, pharynx; black; intestinal lumen; yellow, vulva.</para>
