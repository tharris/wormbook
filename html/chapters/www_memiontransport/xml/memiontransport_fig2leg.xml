<title>Figure 2. Schematic diagram indicating Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> transporters that time defecation.</title>
<para>Proteins are shown in blue. Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> is represented by yellow dots, with movement through the transporters denoted by yellow arrows. Positive and negative regulation by Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> is shown in red, with lipid signaling molecules in black. Nematode genes are in italics under the more widely-used protein names. In brief, oscillations in cytoplasmic Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> are thought to occur through sequential PLC&gamma; mediated stimulation of the IP3R concurrent with de-suppression of TRPM, followed by ER store Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> release and Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> feedback regulation of the three proteins involved. Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> moves through cells via an insect gap junction innexin, which contributes to Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> wave propagation. PLC&beta; has an undefined role in wave propagation that is independent of the IP3R, but may relate to its presence at the gap junction. Store repletion by the SERCA pump restores Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> to baseline levels. Inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3), IP3 Receptor (IP3R), Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin (TRPM), phospholipase C (PLC), sarco-endoplasmic reticular Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> ATPase (SERCA), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), diacylglycerol (DAG), endoplasmic reticulum (ER).</para>
