<title>Figure 3. Schematic diagram indicating Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> transport and signaling pathways that regulate fertilization.</title>
<para>Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> is represented by yellow dots, with its transport indicated by a yellow block arrow. Red arrows denote regulatory pathways. Several different cell types are important for fertilization, including sheath cells, spermatheca and the oocyte. The role of each of these cells has to be precisely coordinated in order for effective fertilization to occur. Hence, communication between cells is essential. Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> signaling pathways have been shown to operate through discrete mechanisms in each cell to coordinate fertilization and assure the proper sequence of events. Inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3), IP3 Receptor (IP3R), Voltage activated chloride channel (CLC), Oxidative stress responsive kinase 1/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (OSR/SPAK), Protein phosphatase (PP), Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> release-activated Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> modulator 1 (Orai1), Stromal interaction molecule (Stim), Extracellular signal related kinase (ERK), ERK kinase (ERKK), Ca<superscript>2+</superscript>-calmodulin dependent kinase type II (CaMKII), Epidermal grown factor (EGF), EGF receptor, (EGFR), Ephrin receptor (EphR), Major sperm protein (MSP), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), phospholipase C (PLC), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), diacylglycerol (DAG), endoplasmic reticulum (ER).</para>
