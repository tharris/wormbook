<title>Figure 4. Protons at work: transport and signaling in the intestine.</title>
<para>In this schematic diagram, protons are represented by red dots and their transport by red block arrows. Sodium transport is shown as tan arrows. Transport of nutrients such as dipeptide Gly-Pro or folate is represented by green arrows. At rest, a large pH gradient exists in the intestine, with the lumen pH 4 &laquo; cytoplasm pH 7.5 &ap; pseudocoelom pH 7.5. During defecation, the lumen becomes more alkaline and the cytoplasm and pseudocoelom more acidic. Panel 3B represents the timing and magnitude of the changes in pH that occur during defecation relative to Ca<superscript>2+</superscript> and the execution of the posterior body wall muscle contraction <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0001641;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">pBoc</ulink>. Protons are a substrate for transport by sodium proton exchangers and V-ATPases, which maintain pH homeostasis, and for proton-dipeptide symporters, which take up dipeptide nutrients. Protons also regulate other transporters, such as SLC19A3, which is perhaps representative of a general role in nutrient uptake. On the basolateral side of the cell, activation of proton receptors allows adjacent cells to communicate and may represent a novel role for NHEs in this process.
