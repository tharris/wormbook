<caption>    <formalpara>        <title>Figure 1. Cartoon representation of gonadogenesis</title>        <para>(A) Cartoon representation of fertilization and the embryonic germ line. Oocyte and sperm meet and fertilization initiates embryonic development. Germline lineages are depicted in yellow. (B) Cartoon representation of post-embryonic hermaphrodite gonad development. Comparative size of gonads at different stages is not to scale. Germline color scheme: yellow mitotic region, light green transition (early prophase of meiosis I), dark green pachytene, dark blue spermatogenesis, and pink oogenesis. The mitosis/meiosis border is indicated in the late-L3 and late-L4 by light green arrows. In the adult, the mitosis/meiosis border is not sharp (mitotic and meiotic nuclei are interspersed at the border) as indicated here by a yellow/green color gradient. Somatic gonad color scheme: red DTC, blue sheath/spermatheca precursor cells, light blue sheath nuclei, grey spermatheca, and white uterus. Germline nuclei and their surrounding cytoplasm are often referred to as "germ cells", though they are open to a core of shared cytoplasm (rachis) during much of their development.</para>    </formalpara></caption>
