<title>Figure 5. The intercistronic region of an SL2-type operon with a second polyA site just upstream of the trans-splice site.</title>
<para>This kind of operon has two, alternatively used polyA sites, a proximal site at ~100 bp upstream of the trans-splice site, and a distal site just upstream of the trans-splice site. When the distal site is used, subsequent trans-splicing of the downstream gene is impossible. The sequence shown is from the proximal polyA signal of <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=F55A12.3;class=Gene" role="_blank">F55A12.3</ulink> to the translation start site of <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00018863;class=Gene" role="_blank">F55A12.2</ulink>. The polyA signals are underlined. The two sites of polyadenylation are underlined and boldface. Both sites are used based on known 3&apos; end formation and both show ChIP-seq CstF-64 peaks (data not shown). The trans-splice site is underlined and italicized. <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00018863;class=Gene" role="_blank">F55A12.2</ulink> is trans-spliced 97% of the time to SL2 (196 reads in the transcriptome data (<link linkend="bib1">Allen et al., 2011</link><!--: PMID 21177958-->)).</para>
