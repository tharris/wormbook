<title>Figure 1. A typical SL2-type operon.</title>
<para>The figure shows a four-gene operon with exons shown as colored boxes and introns as angled lines. The direction of transcription is from left to right, as indicated by the arrows on the 3&apos; UTRs. The green bar denotes the extent of the operon. The pre-mRNA is processed to yield multiple mature mRNAs. The first gene in the operon <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00007626;class=Gene" role="_blank">rnf-121</ulink></emphasis> is trans-spliced mostly to SL1, whereas the three downstream genes are trans-spliced mostly to SL2 (data from <link linkend="bib1">Allen et al. 2011</link><!--: PMID 21177958-->). In each case, the 3&apos; cleavage sites are ~100 bp upstream of the SL2-specific trans-splice sites. This is a download from <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/">Wormbase</ulink>. There are &gt;1200 documented operons of this type in the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> genome (<link linkend="bib1">Allen et al., 2011</link><!--: PMID 21177958-->). Here and throughout, the number of SL1 and SL2 reads shown is data from the deep sequencing project reported in <link linkend="bib1">Allen et al. (2011)</link><!--: PMID 21177958-->. Sequencing was performed on RNA isolated from several different worm stages and the data pooled. Below the operon bar, H3K9ac ChIP/chip performed on young adult worms, which marks active promoters, is shown. The length of the vertical lines is proportional to the intensity of the hybridization signal corresponding to the indicated genomic position. The horizontal black bar marks a peak called by the data analysis program.</para>
