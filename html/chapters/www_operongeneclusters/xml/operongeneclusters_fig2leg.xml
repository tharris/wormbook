<title>Figure 2. The intercistronic region from a typical hybrid operon.</title>
<para>In this kind of operon, there is a promoter at the 5&apos; end of the cluster (not shown) and an additional promoter between the genes as shown by H3K9ac ChIP/chip data (bottom). In the example shown here, the intercistronic distance is longer than in a typical operon (~500 bp). Transcripts from the promoter at the 5&apos; end of the cluster undergo 3&apos; end formation of C23H3.5.2, along with SL2 trans-splicing at the 5&apos; end of <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00016020;class=Gene" role="_blank">sptl-1</ulink></emphasis>. The internal promoter is responsible for synthesis of an outron that is trans-spliced by SL1 at the same site. In this example there are 192 SL2 and 481 SL1 reads at the site indicated by the vertical arrow for <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00016020;class=Gene" role="_blank">sptl-1</ulink></emphasis> (<link linkend="bib1">Allen et al., 2011</link><!--: PMID 21177958-->). Below the operon bar H3K9ac ChIP/chip, which marks active promoters, is shown. The length of the vertical lines is proportional to the number of reads corresponding to the indicated genomic position. The horizontal black bar marks a peak called by the data analysis program.</para>
