<para><emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00018319;class=Gene" role="_blank">hdac-6</ulink></emphasis>, which encodes a histone deacetylase, can be processed in either of two ways. When exon 9 is skipped, a full length <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00018319;class=Gene" role="_blank">hdac-6</ulink></emphasis> mRNA is synthesized by splicing exon 8 to exon 10. When exon 8 is spliced to exon 9, 3&apos; end formation at the end of exon 9 occurs and is accompanied by SL2 trans-splicing just downstream, at the 5&apos; end of exon 10, thereby creating a nine-exon upstream mRNA and a two-exon downstream mRNA.</para>
