<title>Figure 3. Intercistronic lengths of genes grouped by % SL2 trans-splicing.</title>
<para>Data is from <link linkend="bib1">Allen et al (2011)</link><!--: PMID 21177958-->. All genes whose distances to the next upstream polyA addition site was 1000 bp or less and that were trans-spliced were analyzed for number of SL2 reads divided by total trans-spliced reads. The genes are grouped according to level of SL2 trans-splicing, and plotted (# of genes in each 10 bp bin of intercistronic distance). The number of genes plotted is: 80-100% SL2: 1232; 11-79% SL2: 520; 0-10% SL2: 1272.</para>
