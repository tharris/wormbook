        <title>Figure 1. Microinjection of the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> gonad</title>
        <para>The optimal position of the injection needle in the cytoplasmic core of the distal germ line is depicted. For DNA transformation, injection solution should flow in both directions through both the distal and proximal germ line (arrows). Note: The optimal hermaphrodite would be several hours older than the one shown here, with a larger gonad syncytium that has a larger, more obvious cytoplasmic core.</para>
