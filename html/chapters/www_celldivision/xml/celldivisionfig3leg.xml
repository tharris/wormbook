        <title>Figure 3. Nuclear envelope dynamics in the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> embryo</title>
        <para>Figure courtesy of Vincent Galy. (A) Schematics illustrate the cycle of nuclear envelope breakdown and reassembly. (B) Still images of the first mitotic division of wild-type embryos expressing YFP-Lamin (left) and GFP-MAN1 (right). Times on the right are relative to first metaphase to anaphase transition. Arrowheads indicate the reappearance of GFP-MAN1 around the chromatin at t=60 sec and YFP-Lamin at t=120 sec. White stars mark the positions of the centrosomes. Note the persistence of membranes containing GFP-MAN1 around the mitotic spindle and centrosomes. Scale bar = 10&#x003BC;m.</para>
