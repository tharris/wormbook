        <title>Figure 2. Nuclear envelope dynamics in the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> embryo.</title>
        <para>(Left column) Schematics illustrate the major features of the first division. Approximate times are in minutes:seconds after nuclear envelope breakdown. (Middle column) Images of each stage in a strain expressing GFP: beta-tubulin and GFP: histone to simultaneously visualize the microtubule cytoskeleton and the DNA. The top image of anaphase of meiosis II was taken from a movie collected by wide-field microscopy. All subsequent images are of the same embryo and were collected by spinning disk confocal microscopy (images courtesy of Carrie Cowan). (Right column) Stills from a timelapse sequence of an embryo expressing GFP:myosin II (images courtesy of Amy Maddox; strain provided by Ed Munro). For each time point, three spinning disk confocal images of the embryo surface were collected at 1 <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03BC;</symbol>m intervals and projected. During polar body extrusion, ruffles form over the entire cortex. Foci of myosin II are apparent at the base of each of the ingressing ruffles. As polarity is established, myosin II concentrates in an anterior cortical cap that persists into metaphase (<link linkend="bib96">Munro et al., 2004</link><!--; PMID 15363415-->). During cytokinesis, an equatorial band of cortical myosin II forms in the plane defined by the spindle midzone. Figure courtesy of Amy Maddox.</para>
