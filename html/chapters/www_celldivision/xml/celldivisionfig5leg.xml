        <para>(A) Schematic of the first cycle of centrosome duplication that immediately follows
            fertilization. Figure and electron micrographs courtesy of Amy Maddox and Thomas

            Centrosome duplication consists of alternating cycles of new centriole assembly and
            splitting of the centriole pairs. A pair of centrioles (grey) enters the egg with the
            sperm during fertilization. The sperm centrioles acquire pericentriolar material (PCM;
            orange) in the egg and begin to nucleate microtubule asters. New daughter centrioles
            (green) assemble adjacent to each of the sperm centrioles so that by metaphase each
            centrosome contains two full-length centrioles, one inherited from the sperm and one
            that formed in the embryo cytoplasm. As the embryo enters mitosis, the amount of PCM
            around the centrioles and the number of microtubules nucleated by the centrosomes
            increases in a process called centrosome maturation. The centriole pairs split in late
            anaphase/telophase and the mitotic PCM breaks down, so that each daughter cell inherits
            a pair of small centrosomes each containing a single centriole. (B) Two images of
            prometaphase/metaphase centrioles with singlet microtubules in either cross section
            (arrows) or a longitudinal orientation (arrowhead) are shown. Bar is 250 nm.</para>
