        <title>Figure 4. Kinetics of pronuclear migration in the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> embryo.</title>
        <para>Timelapse DIC sequences of 20 wild-type and 16 gamma-tubulin depleted embryos were collected. The average position of
            the oocyte-derived and sperm-derived pronuclei along the anterior-posterior axis of the
            embryo is plotted (x-axis) as a function of time (y-axis). Times are with respect to
            pronuclear meeting. The sperm pronucleus moves towards the embryo anterior at a uniform
            slow rate. The oocyte pronucleus initially moves towards the embryo posterior at a
            similar slow rate (Slow phase), but then speeds up prior to nuclear meeting (Fast
            phase). Pronuclear migration depends on the timing of formation and size of centrosomal
            microtubule asters. In embryos, depleted of gamma-tubulin centrosomal microtubule asters
            form later than in wild-type (<link linkend="bib53">Hannak et al., 2002</link><!--; PMID 12011109-->) and the fast phase of
            pronuclear migration is not observed. A similar phenotype has been characterized in
            embryos mutant for the centrosomal protein <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/protein?name=SPD-2;class=protein" role="_blank">SPD-2</ulink>, in which the centrosomal microtubule
            asters are highly attenuated (<link linkend="bib103">O'Connell et al., 2000</link><!--; PMID 10885746-->). Figure courtesy of Eva Hannak and Stephan Grill.</para>
