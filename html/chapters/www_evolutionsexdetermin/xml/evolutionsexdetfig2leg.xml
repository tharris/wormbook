        <para>Though mammals, <emphasis>Drosophila</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> all use GSD, they interpret their sex
            chromosome content through distinct signal transduction pathways. However, all three
            eventually converge on a DM family member whose expression is associated with male
            development. <emphasis>Drosophila</emphasis> <emphasis>Dsx</emphasis> is unusual for DM genes in also having an important role in
            female development (through a female-specific splice variant).</para>
