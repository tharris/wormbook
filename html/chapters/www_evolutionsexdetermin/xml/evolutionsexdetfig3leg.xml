        <title>Figure 3. Models for germline sex determination in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis></title>
        <para>(A) <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, and (B) <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis>. In both panels, arrows indicate positive
            regulation, and crossbars indicate repressive regulation. With the exception of <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=fog-3" role="_blank">fog-3</ulink></emphasis>,
            the genes in black type are also crucial in somatic sex determination. Mechanisms promoting the initiation of hermaphrodite spermatogenesis are colored green, and those promoting the switch to oogenesis are colored red. Though it is likely that <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> hermaphroditism is controlled by genes regulating the core pathway downstream of the <emphasis>Cb-fems</emphasis>, their identity is unknown. See text for full explanation.</para>
