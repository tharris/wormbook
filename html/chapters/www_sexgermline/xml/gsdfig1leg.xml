        <para>Proteins are shown in capital letters, and are indicated when the regulatory
            interactions are known to take place at this level; in all other cases, gene names are
            used and are shown in italics. Positive interactions are indicated with an arrow, and
            negative ones by a “--|”. Genes that promote spermatogenesis are blue, and those that
            promote oogenesis are red. Not shown are sex-determination and dosage compensation genes
            that act upstream of <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/protein?name=HER-1;class=protein" role="_blank">HER-1</ulink>, which also form part of the “global” sex determination
            pathway (see <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_somaticsexdeterm/somaticsexdeterm.html" role="_blank">Somatic sex determination</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_dosagecomp/dosagecomp.html" role="_blank">X-chromosome dosage compensation</ulink>).</para>
