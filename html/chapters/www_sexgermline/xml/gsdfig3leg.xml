        <title>Figure 3. Regulatory modules that promote spermatogenesis</title>
        <para>Proteins are shown in uppercase, and genes or mRNAs in lowercase italics. Positive
            interactions are indicated with an arrow, and negative ones by a “--|”. Genes that
            promote spermatogenesis are blue, and those that promote oogenesis are red. Regulatory
            circuits that promote hermaphrodite spermatogenesis are highlighted in gray.</para>
