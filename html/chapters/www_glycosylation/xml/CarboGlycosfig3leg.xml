		<title>Figure 3. Comparative overview of the major types of vertebrate N-glycan subtypes and some representative <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> N-glycans</title>
		<para><emphasis role="underline">Top panel</emphasis>: Vertebrate diversification in the Golgi apparatus generates high-mannose, hybrid and complex N-glycan subtypes. Most cell surface and secreted N-glycans are of the complex subtype. Vertical arrows indicate locations of branch formation in diversification, not all of which occur on a single N-glycan. (Adapted from (<link linkend="bib101">Varki et al., 1999</link><!--; ISBN 0-87969-560-9-->) <emphasis role="underline">Bottom panel</emphasis>: The main classes of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> N-glycans include high-mannose (up to Man9GlcNAc2), pauci-mannosidic and hybrid type. Note that this scheme only includes some of the documented structures.</para>
