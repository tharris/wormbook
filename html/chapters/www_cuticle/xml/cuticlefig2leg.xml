		<title>Figure 2. Schematic representation of a typical cuticle collagen.</title>
		<para>The cuticle collagens share a common three-domain structure with non-collagenous amino and carboxy domains and a central Gly-X-Y collagen domain. The collagen domain contains variable small interruptions. Highly conserved clusters of cysteine residues flank the collagen domain and are present within one of the interruptions. It is predicted that proteolysis via the conserved subtilisin cleavage site removes much of the amino terminal domain of all cuticle collagens. A subset of cuticle collagens is also processed via a C-terminal BMP-like site.</para>
