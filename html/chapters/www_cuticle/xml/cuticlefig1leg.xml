		<title>Figure 1. The organization and structure of the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> cuticle</title>
		<para>Panel A shows a scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the surface of a wild type adult stage animal and an accompanying schematic representation. Panel B is a transmission electron micrograph (TEM) depicting a longitudinal cross-section of the adult cuticle highlighting the distinct structural layers and their composition. With the exception of the epicuticle and surface coat, collagens are present in all major layers. Cuticlins are restricted to the cortical layer. The epicuticle contains lipids and is covered by a glycoprotein-rich coat. Panel C depicts the synthesis of a new cuticle and the associated detachment of the old cuticle. The annular pattern of the outer cuticle layer is established by invaginations in the surface of the hypodermal membrane and corresponds to the position of circumferential actin bundles which form early in lethargus. Later in lethargus, the actin bundles dissociate, the invaginations disappear and the non-invaginated inner layers of the cuticle are deposited. Thus the annular pattern is restricted to the outer layer of the cuticle.</para>
