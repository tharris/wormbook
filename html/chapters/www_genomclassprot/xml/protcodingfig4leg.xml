        <title> Figure 4. Coverage of genes by protein families</title>
        <para>The genes are sorted for maximum non-redundancy so that a gene falling into both a
            large and a small family is assigned to the small family; the results are then listed
            from the most common to the most uncommon families. Both InterPro and NCBI KOG/TWOG/LSE families cover significant numbers of genes, but the latter are more extensive.</para>
