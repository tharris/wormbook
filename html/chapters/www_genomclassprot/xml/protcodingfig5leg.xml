        <title>Figure 5. Overall distribution of protein families among genes</title>
        <para>Both InterPro and NCBI (KOG/TWOG/LSE) families are shown. There is significant
            overlap, but the NCBI families are more extensive. A fifth of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> genes encode nematode-specific protein families (LSEs) of various types, while another fifth are not easily identifiable by homology.</para>
