        <title>Figure 8. Frequency with which protein families are encoded by small or large numbers
            of genes</title>
        <para>Both scales are logarithmic, to make the large variations easy to see. At one extreme,
            hundreds or thousands of families are encoded by only one gene apiece in the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> genome. At the other extreme are instances of single protein families encoded by  hundreds of genes.</para>
