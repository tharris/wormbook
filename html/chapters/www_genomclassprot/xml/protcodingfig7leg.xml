        <title>Figure 7. Number of genes encoding members of the 100 most extensive InterPro or NCBI  families</title>
        <para>This shows that less than 10 families in either set are truly disproportionate in the number of genes encoding them (i.e., shoot far above a linear curve). However, the next 90 families, while also numerous, follow a more steadily declining distribution of sizes.</para>
