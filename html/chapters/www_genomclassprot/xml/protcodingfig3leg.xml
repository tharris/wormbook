        <para>Size distribution of proteins, listed by the number of proteins sharing each possible
            residue length. (In contrast, Figure 2 shows a series of individual proteins ascending in
            size.) Most proteins scatter broadly between ~80 and 1000 residues, but there is a
            noticeable peak at ~340 residues which corresponds to a large family of predicted
            7-transmembrane receptors (Robertson, 2000<!-- ; PMID10673277 -->).</para>
