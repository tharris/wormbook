        <title>Figure 2. Enhancement between hypomorphic mutations in two genes that act sequentially in a pathway</title>
        <para>A hypomorphic mutation in the first gene results in less product for the second step, which requires the second gene. If this gene is also crippled by a hypomorphic mutation, the final product or output of the pathway can be below a critical threshold. Hypomorphic mutations in two genes can also enhance each other if the genes encode components of a complex. A complex with only one crippled component may still have adequate function, but the presence of two crippled components, as occurs in the double mutant, may cause complete inactivity or disruption of the complex.</para>
