        <title>Figure 1. Synthetic interaction between <emphasis>mec-8</emphasis> and <emphasis>sym-3</emphasis> </title>
        <para>(A) The <emphasis>mec-8; sym-3</emphasis> double mutant has a highly penetrant defect: the anterior tip (arrow) of the pharynx is not properly joined to the anterior tip of the body  (arrowhead), and a functional mouth is not formed. Unable to feed, hatchlings arrest
            growth and development during the first larval stage. The mutants also have a bulbous
            nose, an enlargement of the anterior-most part of the body, which is particularly
            evident in the example shown here. The junction of the pharynx and anterior end of the
            body is normal in the <emphasis>sym-3</emphasis> single mutant (B) and in the <emphasis>mec-8</emphasis> single mutant (C). Scale
