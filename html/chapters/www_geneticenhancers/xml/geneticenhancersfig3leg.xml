        <title>Figure 3. A screen for synthetic interactions based on RNAi-feeding libraries </title>
        <para> The drawing depicts progeny of a mother that was chromosomally homozygous for a
            molecular null mutation in a gene (<emphasis>gene-A</emphasis>) that confers no obvious phenotype on its own.
            The mother was also transgenic for an extrachromosomal array that expresses a GFP marker
            and a wild-type version of <emphasis>gene-A</emphasis>. Some of the progeny have inherited the array and are
           <emphasis> gene-A(+)</emphasis> and green fluorescent, and others have not inherited the array and are
            therefore minus for <emphasis>gene-A</emphasis> and for the GFP marker. Being homozygous for the mutation in
            <emphasis>gene-A</emphasis> has no apparent effect on growth, development, and fertility of worms grown on a
            bacterial lawn (left plate) that expresses dsRNA that depletes <emphasis>gene-B</emphasis>. In contrast, a
            possible synthetic interaction between <emphasis>gene-A</emphasis> and <emphasis>gene-C</emphasis> is indicated by differential
            morphologies between array-plus (green) and array-minus (white) progeny when grown on a
            lawn of bacteria expressing dsRNA against <emphasis>gene-C</emphasis> (right plate). The lack of an effect on
            the transgenic [and therefore <emphasis>gene-A(+)</emphasis>] progeny indicates&#x02014;but does not prove&#x02014;that both
            genes <emphasis>A</emphasis> and <emphasis>C</emphasis> must be depleted before a phenotype is manifested.</para>
