		<title>Figure 1. Structure of chemosensory organs.</title>
		<para>a. Disposition of chemosensory neurons in the animal. Each of the two amphids contains 12 associated chemosensory or thermosensory neurons. Each of the two phasmids contains 2 chemosensory neurons, PHA and PHB. There are six inner labial organs, each of which contains one IL2 chemosensory and one IL1 mechanosensory neuron. There are two URX neurons, one <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=AQR;class=Cell" role="_blank">AQR</ulink> neuron, and one <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=PQR;class=Cell" role="_blank">PQR</ulink> neuron; the endings of these neurons are within the animal, and not exposed. b. Detailed structure of the amphid sensory opening showing the socket (so), sheath (sh), and ciliated nerve endings. AWA, AWB, AWC, and AFD endings are buried in the sheath and not exposed through the amphid pore. c. Detailed structure of the cilia in the 12 classes of amphid neurons. Panels b and c are adapted from <link linkend="bib130">Perkins et al. (1986)</link>.</para>
