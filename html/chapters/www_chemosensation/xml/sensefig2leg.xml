		<title>Figure 2. The pirouette model for chemotaxis.</title>
		<para>a. A simulated animal starting at point x with an attractant at point y changes direction once per minute when attractant is constant, twice per minute when attractant is decreasing, and once every two minutes when attractant is increasing. The direction change is always random, but the animal eventually reaches the attractant. The biased random walk was generated using a random number table. b. Representative trace of a wild-type animal during chemotaxis from origin (*) to attractant (+). Color indicates the passage of time during the assay. Note short trajectories away from attractant, and longer trajectories toward attractant. Adapted from <link linkend="bib132">Pierce-Shimomura et al. (2005)</link>.</para>
