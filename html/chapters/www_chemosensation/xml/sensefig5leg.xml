		<title>Figure 5. Potential signal transduction pathway for nociception in ASH cilia.</title>
		<para>Genetic results support the importance of Gi-like proteins, biosynthetic enzymes for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and TRPV channels for all forms of ASH nociception, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for some forms of ASH nociception. A likely model is that repellents are detected by GPCRs and possibly by other molecules such as ion channels. GPCRs activate the Gi-like proteins <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=ODR-3;class=Protein" role="_blank">ODR-3</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=GPA-3;class=Protein" role="_blank">GPA-3</ulink>, which regulate the production or consumption of phospholipids containing PUFAs (omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids). The GPCR kinase <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=GRK-2;class=Protein" role="_blank">GRK-2</ulink> also promotes ASH activation. Lipid mobilization opens the TRPV channels encoded by <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=OSM-9;class=Protein" role="_blank">OSM-9</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=OCR-2;class=Protein" role="_blank">OCR-2</ulink> to depolarize the cell. TRPV channels may also be directly activated by mechanical, chemical or osmotic stimuli, perhaps with the assistance of accessory subunits such as <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=OSM-1;class=Protein" role="_blank">OSM-10</ulink>.</para>
