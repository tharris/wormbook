		<title>Figure 2: Dimorphism of the buccal cavity.</title>
		<para>Dorsal is left. (a) Stenostomatous mouth form, which is slightly deeper than wide (compare the distance between the parallel dashed lines and the width of the buccal cavity) and a flint-like dorsal tooth (arrowhead). (b-c) Eurystomatous mouth form with a broader buccal cavity, showing the same individual at different focal planes. Notice a claw-like dorsal tooth (b, arrow head), and an adjacent row of denticles (c, arrow). Scale bar represents 5 <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x003BC;</symbol>m in all panels.
