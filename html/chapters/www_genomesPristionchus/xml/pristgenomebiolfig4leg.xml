		<para>Phylogenic maximum likelihood tree based on <emphasis>SSU</emphasis> sequences of the genus <emphasis>Pristionchus</emphasis>. The sequence of <emphasis>Koerneria</emphasis> sp. was included as the closest related genus to <emphasis>Pristionchus</emphasis>. The phylogenetic relationship was inferred by the heuristic search algorithm of the PAUP*4.0b10 program using the default settings under the maximum likelihood criterion. The tree was rooted at midpoint. Hermaphroditic and gonochoristic species are indicated. Numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap values after 1000 replications.
