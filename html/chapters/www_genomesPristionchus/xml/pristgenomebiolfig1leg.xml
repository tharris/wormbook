		<title>Figure 1: Life cycle of <emphasis>P. pacificus </emphasis> in comparison to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>.</title>
		<para><emphasis>P. pacificus</emphasis> propagates through four juvenile stages, called J1 to J4. In contrast to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, the J1 to J2 molt is embryonic and only the J2 stage hatches from the egg. Dauer formation occurs as alternative J3 stage, as in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. The direct life cycle takes approximately 4 days at 20&#x000B0;C.
