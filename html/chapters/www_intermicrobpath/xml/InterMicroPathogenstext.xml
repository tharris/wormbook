    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>Nematodes began feeding on microbes long before the emergence  of vertebrates. Microbial mechanisms to fend off nematodes - and perhaps even turn the animals into the microbe's food - must be of equally ancient origin. It is likely, then, that many of the microbial processes at work in human infectious diseases are adaptations of pathways that first evolved as defenses against nematodes. To the extent that this is the case, <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> can provide information about these virulence mechanisms that can be difficult to obtain with traditional animal models.</para>
    <para>To fully understand a pathogen, researchers ideally would screen the microbe's genome comprehensively to identify all virulence genes. When mice or other mammals are the experimental host, such screens are impractical and prohibitively expensive, inasmuch as they require many thousands of animals. With <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, the requirement for animals is not limiting because they grow rapidly in a simple and inexpensive culture system: production of 10,000 animals is trivial. As a result, a number of screens have been performed in which thousands of pathogen mutants have been tested individually against worms.</para>
    <para>Of course, <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> offers far more than mere fecundity. Three decades of research has provided an extensive collection of mutants and clones that are available as off-the-shelf reagents for analysis of the host side of pathogen-host interactions. <emphasis>De novo</emphasis> genetic analysis of the host is feasible, e.g. by screening <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> for mutants that are either resistant or hypersensitive to a pathogen. Screens for hypersensitive mutants have been especially productive in elucidating  the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> innate immune system, as described in <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_signalingimmuneresponse/signalingimmuneresponse.html" role="_blank">Signaling in the immune response</ulink> by Jonathan J. Ewbank.</para>
    <para>For convenience, pathogenic effects on <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>  can be divided into two broad categories. In one, the nematode becomes infected, and presence of whole, live microbes within the animal or attached to the cuticle is correlated with death or disease. In the other, secreted microbial products, i.e. toxins, are responsible for symptoms, and <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> need not be exposed to live organisms. These categories are not mutually exclusive: one well-studied pathogen, <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>, has a "slow killing" mode involving colonization of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> as well as two toxin-mediated pathways. Furthermore, it is not trivial to discern the mode of killing, and often pathogenesis appears to be multifactoral.</para>
    <para><link linkend="table1">Table 1</link> lists microbial species known to be pathogenic to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, most of which are also human pathogens. Two of the pathogens (<emphasis>Drechmeria coniospora</emphasis> and <emphasis>Cryptococcus neoformans</emphasis>) are fungi, and the remainder are bacteria. Some of the bacteria, e.g. <emphasis>Yersinia</emphasis> sp. and <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> sp., are known to invade host cells during mammalian infections, but invasion of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> cells has not been reported. No viruses or non-fungal eukaryotic parasites have been shown to infect or kill <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>.</para>
     <para>Following are brief descriptions of the pathogens and their effects on <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. In this chapter, "virulence factor" means any pathogen molecule involved in infection, including those that directly affect the host as well as those that function in the pathogen's own physiology, metabolism, and regulation. "Effector" and "toxin" refer to the subset of virulence factors that act directly on the host organism. For the sake of brevity, references have been omitted for general background on the pathogens.</para>

       <title>Bacterial infections of the intestine</title>
       <para>Numerous bacteria infect <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. Experimenters take advantage of the fact that <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> eats microbes and simply place L4 or young adult animals on pathogen lawns to initiate infection. The transparency of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> allows direct observation of infectious organisms within the worm by differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC); this is facilitated by using pathogens transformed to express green fluorescent protein (GFP; <xref linkend="figure1" />). In many cases, the intestine becomes distended; it is not apparent whether this is due simply to physical pressure exerted by the growing pathogen or to some physiological response of the nematode. Colonization can be quantified by grinding worms into a homogenate,  plating on solid media, and counting colonies. Mortality is usually reported as time for 50% of animals to die (LT<subscript>50</subscript>).</para>

       <para><emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> OP50, the standard laboratory food, does not colonize wild-type <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, but many pathogens do. Is intestinal colonization deleterious <emphasis>per se</emphasis>? It appears that the answer is no. <emphasis>Enterococcus faecium</emphasis> heavily colonizes the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> gut, growing to a titer of more than 10<superscript>4</superscript> bacteria per nematode, without causing significant mortality (<link linkend="bib17">Garsin et al., 2001</link><!-- PMID 11535834 -->). This implies that when microbial killing occurs, there are specific pathogenic mechanisms at work.</para>
       <sect2>
       <title><emphasis>Enterococcus faecalis</emphasis></title>
       <para><emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> is a Gram-positive organism that is part of the normal gut flora of many persons, but is also a serious pathogen that can cause meningitis, endocarditis and urinary tract infections. <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> colonizes <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> and kills fairly rapidly, with an LT<subscript>50</subscript> of about 4 days (d) (<link linkend="bib17">Garsin et al., 2001</link><!-- PMID 11535834 -->). Continuous feeding on <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> is not necessary for heavy colonization; a small inoculum  proliferates in the animal. Death was more rapid with <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> expressing cytolysin, an effector that can lyse host cells. <emphasis>E. faecalis</emphasis> with a deletion in <emphasis>fsrB</emphasis>, part of a quorum-sensing system that responds to high culture density, was attenuated for killing, but colonized as efficiently as its wild-type parent.</para>
<?newpage?>
       <para>Mutations in two protease genes under <emphasis>fsrB</emphasis> regulation, <emphasis>gelE</emphasis> and <emphasis>sprE</emphasis>, produced milder defects, suggesting that both <emphasis>fsrB</emphasis>-regulated effectors are involved in killing (<link linkend="bib40">Sifri et al., 2002</link><!-- PMID 12228293 -->). The <emphasis>fsrB</emphasis> mutant was also attenuated in a mouse model for peritonitis, establishing a connection between the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> model and mammalian infection.</para>

       <title><emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis></title>
       <para><emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>  is known to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> researchers primarily as worm food. The natural environment of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> is the digestive tract of warm-blooded animals, and in nature <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> is likely to encounter it only sporadically, e.g., in animal feces. In humans, <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> can be either a harmless component of the natural gut flora or a serious pathogen.</para>
       <para><emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> lived longer when grown on a common soil organism, <emphasis>Bacillus subtilis</emphasis>, than on the laboratory food strain of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, OP50 (<link linkend="bib18">Garsin et al., 2003</link><!-- PMID 12817143 -->). Furthermore, when worms were fed OP50 grown on brain-heart infusion, a rich medium, their lifespan was shorter than with OP50 grown on standard NGM medium, a relatively poor source of bacterial nutrition (<link linkend="bib17">Garsin et al., 2001</link><!-- PMID 11535834 -->). These results suggest that <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> is mildly pathogenic to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> and that virulence increases on rich media. OP50 is a domesticated laboratory strain that lacks the O-antigen component of its outer membrane (S.L. Ananth and C.D., unpublished data), and is therefore not typical of pathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>.</para>
       <para>In mammalian infections, enteropathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (EPEC) produces attaching and effacing (AE) lesions in which microvilli of the small intestine are degraded and the bacteria intimately attach to the host epithelium. EPEC infection causes watery diarrhea in infants, which can lead to death by dehydration. <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> exposed to EPEC on NGM medium died prematurely, with an LT<subscript>50</subscript> of 6.5 d, compared to 9.5 d for animals fed an <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> K-12 control strain (J. Mellies, personal communication). After 24 h of exposure, EPEC titer was about 10<superscript>4</superscript> per nematode, versus about 10<superscript>2</superscript> for the controls. Microcolonies of EPEC expressing GFP were found primarily in the posterior intestine, and colonization was dependent on <emphasis>ler</emphasis>, a regulator required for AE lesions. However, <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> colonization does not require a type-three secretion system that injects bacterial proteins into host cytoplasm and is necessary for mammalian AE lesions. Bundle-forming pili, which adhere to mammalian host cells, also were not required in the worm. Furthermore, one EPEC clinical isolate killed  <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> without colonizing, suggesting a toxin-mediated lethality.</para>
       </sect2>
       <sect2>
       <title><emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis></title>
       <para><emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis> is a common soil and water bacterium that is pathogenic to both animals and plants. It rarely affects healthy persons, but can cause devastating infections in patients compromised by inborn genetic defects, acquired diseases, or injuries such as burns. <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> lung infections are a major cause of death in patients with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis.</para>
       <para>Depending on the strain and culture conditions, <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> can kill <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> rapidly by toxin-mediated mechanisms (see below) or slowly in an infectious process. In the "slow killing" model, bacteria colonize the intestine, but during the first 24 h of exposure no strong disease symptoms are observed and mortality is negligible  (<link linkend="bib42">Tan et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 9892699 -->). With continued exposure, the worms gradually cease pharyngeal pumping, become immobile, then die. L4 larvae  are more susceptible than adults, with LT<subscript>50</subscript> of 38 h and 48 h, respectively. Direct observation using <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> expressing GFP showed that bacteria began accumulating 36 h after feeding on the pathogen commenced. The lethal outcome could be prevented by removing the animals from <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> after 12 h of exposure; longer periods before removal resulted in progressively poorer survival. Heat killed bacteria caused no mortality.</para>
       <para>To identify bacterial factors involved in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> killing, Tan et al. screened  2,400 transposon insertions in <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> PA14 and recovered eight mutants (<link linkend="bib43">Tan et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 10051655 -->). Four were severely attenuated, with LT<subscript>50</subscript> greater than 90 h, and each contained an insertion in a regulatory gene. Two of these genes encode transcriptional activators, <emphasis>lasR</emphasis> and <emphasis>ptsP</emphasis>; the others, <emphasis>gacA</emphasis> and <emphasis>lemA</emphasis>, function together in a two-component signal transduction system. The requirement for LasR, the transcriptional activator of a "quorum sensing" system that responds to high bacterial cell density, is consistent with the observation that at least 12 h of colonization was required to produce a lethal infection. The factors under LasR control involved in slow killing have not been determined.</para>
       <para>The eight mutations reducing virulence against <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> were tested in a mouse burn model under conditions that kill 100% of mice infected with wild-type <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib43">Tan et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 10051655 -->). One mutant failed to kill any mice, another killed 100%, and the remaining six had intermediate levels of killing. Among the genes with reduced mouse killing was one which had no matches to known genes in databases at the time it was isolated. This suggests that the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> slow killing model will be useful in identifying additional <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> genes that are important in human infections.</para>
       <para>Slow killing is likely to be multifactoral. A mutation eliminating  exotoxin A, an enzyme that kills eukaryotic cells, was only moderately attenuated (LT<subscript>50</subscript> 55-70 h), suggesting that other effectors contribute to pathogenesis (<link linkend="bib42">Tan et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 9892699 -->). Four effectors that in other systems attack host cytoplasmic functions (exoenzymes S, T, U and Y) are not required for slow killing (<link linkend="bib45">Wareham et al., 2005</link><!-- PMID 15621439 -->).</para>

       <title><emphasis>Salmonella enterica</emphasis></title>
       <para><emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> is a genus of Gram-negative enteric bacteria that cause disease in a variety of vertebrates. In humans, <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> serovar Typhi causes the serious systemic infection known as typhoid fever; however, this organism is not highly pathogenic to mice. Conversely, <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> serovar Typhimurium is lethal to mice, causing a typhoid-like disease, but in humans causes nonfatal infection limited to the gastrointestinal tract. <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> serovar Typhimurium therefore has long been studied in the mouse as a model of systemic infection.</para>
       <para><emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> serovar Typhimurium colonizes the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> intestine (<link linkend="bib3">Aballay et al., 2000</link><!-- PMID 11114525 -->; <link linkend="bib31">Labrousse et al., 2000</link><!-- PMID 11114526 -->). For adults transferred to <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis>  and incubated at 25<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> C, the TD<subscript>50</subscript> was 5.1 d, compared to 9.9 d for control animals on <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> OP50 (<link linkend="bib3">Aballay et al., 2000</link><!-- PMID 11114525 -->). When worms were exposed to <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> for only 3 h, then removed to OP50, there was significant early death. Invasion of host cells is an essential aspect of <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> sp. pathogenesis in mammalian systems, but <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> does not appear to invade <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> cells.</para>
       <para><emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> infection is accompanied by an increase in programmed cell death (PCD) in the germline (<link linkend="bib1">Aballay and Ausubel, 2001</link><!-- PMID 11226309 -->). This requires <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=ced-3" role="_blank">ced-3</ulink></emphasis>  and <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=ced-4" role="_blank">ced-4</ulink></emphasis>, indicating that the germline death involves the canonical PCD pathway that has been studied extensively in somatic cells  (see <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_programcelldeath/programcelldeath.html" role="_blank">Programmed cell death</ulink>). However, there was no evidence that <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> induced somatic cell death. <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=ced-3" role="_blank">ced-3</ulink></emphasis> and <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=ced-4" role="_blank">ced-4</ulink></emphasis>  mutants are more sensitive to <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> infection, suggesting that some PCD-related process is protective. Because the bacterial infection is limited to the intestine, it is not obvious how germline cell death itself could provide this protection. A pleiotropic <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> mutant, which lacks the <emphasis>phoP/phoQ</emphasis> virulence signaling pathway, failed to elicit germline cell death (<link linkend="bib1">Aballay and Ausubel, 2001</link><!-- PMID 11226309 -->), as did mutants for effector secretion (<emphasis>invH</emphasis>) and a transcriptional regulator (<emphasis>hilD</emphasis>; <link linkend="bib44">Tenor et al., 2004</link><!-- PMID 15182677 -->). Two other mutants, which are defective in lipopolysaccharide  synthesis, exhibited reduced levels of killing and failed to trigger PCD, despite accumulating in the intestinal lumen (<link linkend="bib2">Aballay et al., 2003</link><!-- PMID 12526744 -->). In mammalian  cell-culture systems, <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis>  SipB has been shown to be sufficient for apoptosis of host cells (<link linkend="bib22">Hersh et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 10051653 -->); it has not been reported whether SipB is required for <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> germline cell death.</para>
       <para>A screen of 960 transposon insertions in <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> produced 15 mutations with reduced killing of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, only some of which were in known virulence genes (<link linkend="bib44">Tenor et al., 2004</link><!-- PMID 15182677 -->). Some of the mutants were defective in assays for inducing neutrophil migration and invading epithelial cells, suggesting roles in mammalian pathogenesis. The genes represent a wide range of known or putative functions, including transcriptional activation, secretion, adhesion, outer-membrane synthesis and metabolism.</para>

       <title><emphasis>Serratia marcescens</emphasis></title>
       <para><emphasis>Serratia marcescens</emphasis> is a broad-host-range, opportunistic pathogen. This Gram-negative organism colonizes the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> intestine, with an LT<subscript>50</subscript> of approximately 4 d and complete killing in 6-7 d (<link linkend="bib30">Kurz et al., 2003</link><!-- PMID 12660152 -->). Early larvae are resistant to infection, but L4 larvae and adults are highly susceptible. <emphasis>S. marcescens</emphasis> infection of L4s increases the ability of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> cells to pass through the pharynx unlysed, suggesting that the pathogen disrupts the pharyngeal grinder. The infection also causes some intestinal cells to lyse and autofluorescent vacuoles to appear in the lumen. Neither heat-killed <emphasis>S. marcescens</emphasis> nor bacterial culture supernatants caused death, suggesting that killing requires live infection and that a diffusible toxin is not sufficient.</para>
       <para><link linkend="bib30">Kurz et al. (2003<!-- PMID 12660152-->)</link> screened for attenuated bacteria, identifying 19 loci out of 2,300 transposon insertions tested. Fewer than half of the mutants were attenuated in a <emphasis>Drosophila melanogaster</emphasis> model for <emphasis>S. marcescens</emphasis>, and only three were defective in a cytotoxicity assay against human epithelial cells. When the three were tested in a mouse lung infection model, only one was defective, and the mutated gene encodes a hemolysin that has been previously characterized.</para>

Several strains have an LT<subscript>50</subscript> of only about 1 d, making <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> among the swiftest of killers that infect the worm. Exposure of at least 8 h to the pathogen was required for killing.</para>
       <para>Conflicting results were obtained by different laboratories regarding  two well-studied <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> virulence regulators. <link linkend="bib39">Sifri et al. (2003</link>)<!-- PMID 12654843 --> found strong attenuation with mutation of the <emphasis>agr</emphasis> locus and slight attenuation from a mutation in <emphasis>sarA</emphasis>. Working with a different <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> strain, <link linkend="bib4">Bae et al. (2004<!-- PMID 15304642 -->)</link> reported that transposon insertions in either locus did not significantly reduce <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> killing. Both studies found that <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;</symbol>-hemolysin, a secreted protein that lyses mammalian host cells, is important in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> pathogenesis.</para>
       <para>One group that screened for virulence mutations found 10 that were attenuated in more than one <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> strain background (<link linkend="bib5">Begun et al., 2005</link><!-- PMID 15664928-->). Five of the genes identified had been found previously in mammalian models. The other five mutants were tested in a mouse model, and one was significantly attenuated. Because the transposon used for mutagenesis had a strong bias for one chromosomal region, the screen was not comprehensive.</para>
       <para>Another group tested about 1,700 <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> transposon mutants and identified 71 genes, of which 41 could be assigned functions in metabolism, regulation, or production of extracellular factors (<link linkend="bib4">Bae et al., 2004</link><!-- PMID 15304642 -->). Only two extracellular factors, <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;</symbol>-hemolysin and a secreted nuclease, were required for <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> killing.

       <para><emphasis>Microbacterium nematophilum</emphasis> is a Gram-positive organism whose pathogenic effect on <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> was discovered when the bacteria contaminated a laboratory culture (<link linkend="bib23">Hodgkin et al., 2000</link><!-- PMID 11137017 -->). Unlike most of the organism studied with <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> models, <emphasis>M. nematophilum</emphasis> is not known to be a pathogen of mammals.</para>
       <para><emphasis>M. nematophilum</emphasis> colonizes the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> rectum, which is cuticle-lined, and a small peri-anal region of the exterior cuticle (<xref linkend="figure2" />). The area around the anus becomes distended and swollen, a phenotype known as Dar (deformed anal region). The infection is not lethal to wild-type <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, and the animals can grow and reproduce on a pure culture of these bacteria, although more slowly than on <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib23">Hodgkin et al., 2000</link><!-- PMID 11137017-->). However, larvae of several other <emphasis>Caenorhabditis</emphasis> sp., including <emphasis>C. plicata</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. drosophilae</emphasis>, are highly susceptible and die within 24 h of exposure (J. Hodgkin, personal communication). Genetic methods have not been reported for <emphasis>M. nematophilum</emphasis>, and the mechanisms by which it induces Dar are unknown.</para>
       <para>Because <emphasis>M. nematophilum</emphasis> attaches to the cuticle, mutants with altered surface properties were examined. <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=srf-2" role="_blank">srf-2</ulink></emphasis>, <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=srf-3" role="_blank">srf-3</ulink></emphasis> and <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=srf-5" role="_blank">srf-5</ulink></emphasis> animals were not colonized on the peri-anal cuticle and were not Dar (<link linkend="bib23">Hodgkin et al., 2000</link><!-- PMID 11137017-->).

       <para>The Dar response requires components of the ERK MAP kinase cascade (<link linkend="bib37">Nicholas and Hodgkin, 2004</link><!-- PMID 15268855-->), which is also involved in cell fate specification.

      <para>This section describes pathogen models in which the mode of killing, i.e. by infection or intoxication or both, has not been definitively determined, or in which both modes appear to be functional.</para>
      <sect2>
      <title><emphasis>Burkholderia cenocepacia</emphasis></title>
      <para><emphasis>Burkholderia cepacia</emphasis> complex (BCC) is a group of closely related bacteria, including several that can infect the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. BCC is taxonomically complex, with many ambiguities and changes in nomenclature (<link linkend="bib7">Coenye et al., 2001</link><!-- PMID 11574551 -->). In the two studies described in this subsection, different species names were used for the same strain; it is referred to here by the most recently used name, <emphasis>B. cenocepacia</emphasis>.</para>
      <para><emphasis>B. cenocepacia</emphasis> kills <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> slowly when the bacteria and worms are grown on standard media. GFP labeling of the bacteria showed extensive colonization of the intestine in this slow-killing assay, and death occurred in 1-4 d (<link linkend="bib29">Kothe et al., 2003</link><!-- PMID 12713492 -->). On high-osmolarity medium, <emphasis>B. cenocepacia</emphasis> killed completely within 24 h, and there was no detectable colonization in this fast killing. Conditioned media containing <emphasis>B. cenocepacia</emphasis> diffusible products caused some killing under high-osmolarity conditions; curiously, some worms were immobile and appeared dead at 4 h, but had recovered by 24 h. The toxin has not been identified, but cyanide, one of several <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> toxins, was not detected in <emphasis>B. cenocepacia</emphasis> cultures.</para>
      <para>Both modes of killing require the <emphasis>B. cenocepacia cep</emphasis> quorum-sensing regulatory system (<link linkend="bib29">Kothe et al., 2003</link><!-- PMID 12713492 -->). Mutation of a gene under quorum-sensing control, <emphasis>aidA</emphasis>, rendered the bacteria incapable of colonization and slow killing, but did not significantly affect fast killing.</para>
      </sect2>

      <title><emphasis>Burkholderia  pseudomallei</emphasis></title>
      <para>Melioidosis, an infection that can be fatal, is caused by <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis>, a soil organism endemic in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> exposure causes <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> pharyngeal pumping to slow or cease, followed by a general decline in locomotion and eventual death (<link linkend="bib38">O'Quinn et al., 2001</link><!-- PMID 11422081 -->). The most virulent strain assayed had an LT<subscript>50</subscript> of about 10 h. No assay for nematode colonization was reported. Curiously, <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> cells inactivated by ultraviolet irradiation did not kill nematodes, but bacteria treated with high doses of gamma rays retained killing. The speed of the killing and the lethality of gamma-irradiated  cultures suggests the action of a cell-free toxin. However, culture supernatants did not kill, nor did conditioned solid media, which contained diffusible products from bacterial growth but not live bacteria.</para>
      <para>Another study, though, found killing from <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis>-conditioned media, although at reduced levels from that seen with whole cells (<link linkend="bib16">Gan et al., 2002</link><!-- PMID 12068805 -->). The decrease could mean that killing is multifactoral and includes processes that require live bacteria. Alternatively, toxin may be sufficient for killing, but less is available in conditioned media than when <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> is incubated continuously with live bacteria. As with the previous study, colonization of nematodes was not described. In this study, heat-killed bacteria did not kill nematodes, suggesting that the toxin is a protein or other heat labile substance.</para>
      <para>Gan et al. screened 3,400 transposon insertion mutants of <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> and obtained five with reduced killing of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. The five mutants were all attenuated to various degrees when inoculated intranasally into mice  (<link linkend="bib16">Gan et al., 2002</link><!-- PMID 12068805 -->).</para>

      <para><link linkend="bib8">Couillault and Ewbank (2002<!-- PMID 12117988 -->)</link> examined a variety of bacteria, including plant, fish and insect pathogens, assaying survival over time. Diminished lifespan resulted from exposure to a wide range, including plant pathogens <emphasis>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</emphasis>, <emphasis>Erwinia carotovora</emphasis> and <emphasis>Erwinia chrysanthemi</emphasis>; a marine bacterium that spoils stored fish, <emphasis>Shewanella frigidimarinia</emphasis>; and a freshwater fish pathogen that sometimes infects humans, <emphasis>Aeromonas hydrophila</emphasis>.</para>
      <para><emphasis>Photorhabdus luminescens</emphasis> and <emphasis>Xenorhabdus nematophila</emphasis> are related bacteria that live symbiotically in the intestines of <emphasis>Heterorhabditis</emphasis> sp. and <emphasis>Steinernema</emphasis> sp. nematodes, respectively. These entomopathogenic nematodes are parasites of insects, and it is their symbiotic bacteria that kill the insect host. Both <emphasis>Photorhabdus luminescens</emphasis> and <emphasis>Xenorhabdus nematophila</emphasis> were pathogenic to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib8">Couillault and Ewbank, 2002</link><!-- PMID 12117988 -->). Heat-killed <emphasis>X. nematophila</emphasis> retained significant killing ability, suggesting production of a heat-stable diffusible toxin. <emphasis>P. luminescens</emphasis> killing, while particularly rapid, was lost when bacteria were heat killed. <emphasis>X. nematophila</emphasis> colonized the head of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> in a biofilm-like  structure that resembles the one formed by <emphasis>Yersinia</emphasis> sp.</para>

      <title><emphasis>Cryptococcus neoformans</emphasis></title>
      <para><emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis> is a yeast-form fungus that can infect immunocompromised persons. When fed to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, the animals are colonized with a distended intestine and die with an LT<subscript>50</subscript> of 5 - 7 d (<link linkend="bib35">Mylonakis et al., 2002</link><!-- PMID 12438649 -->). Two nonpathogenic cryptococci, <emphasis>C. laurentii</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. keutzingii</emphasis>, did not diminish the worm lifespan; in fact, animals lived longer on <emphasis>C. laurentii</emphasis> than on <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> OP50. Several mutants known to be attenuated in mouse infections were also less pathogenic to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, and a mutation conferring hypervirulence in the mouse model killed <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> more rapidly than wild-type yeasts. These results suggest overlap between disease mechanisms in mammals and <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>Gut colonization is not essential for <emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis> killing. Two <emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis> strains that lack a polysaccharide capsule failed to accumulate in the intestine, but nevertheless killed <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib35">Mylonakis et al., 2002</link><!-- PMID 12438649 -->). Heat-killed capsule-positive yeasts also killed, although more slowly than live fungi, but heat-killed capsule-negative strains were highly attenuated. These results suggest that a component of the <emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis> capsule is toxic.</para>
      <para>A screen of 350 <emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis> insertion mutants yielded seven with attenuated virulence (<link linkend="bib36">Mylonakis et al., 2004</link><!-- PMID 15469513 -->). A mutation in <emphasis>kin1</emphasis>, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, did not affect <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> colonization but produced substantially less killing. The mutation did not alter previously studied <emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis> virulence phenotypes, including capsule formation. When tested in mice by intranasal or intravenous injection, the <emphasis>kin1</emphasis> mutant had a diminished ability to colonize several tissues, and killing was substantially slowed.</para>

      <para><emphasis>D. coniospora</emphasis> is an endoparasitic fungus that infects and consumes a narrow range of nematodes (<link linkend="bib25">Jannson, 1994</link><!-- PMID-->). Conidia, which are spores, attach to the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> head at the labial and amphid sensilla, and also attach to the vulva. The conidia produce threadlike hyphae that grow throughout the animal and consume it. When infection begins at the head, it is not apparent whether the fungus penetrates the cuticle or simply bypasses it by way of the sensilla openings. Protease treatment of worms before exposure decreased conidia attachment, suggesting involvement of nematode surface or secreted proteins. <emphasis>D. coniospora</emphasis> were able to bind <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=che-12" role="_blank">che-12</ulink></emphasis> and <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=che-14" role="_blank">che-14</ulink></emphasis> mutants, which have defective amphids; conidia also bound <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=mec-1" role="_blank">mec-1</ulink></emphasis> animals, which have displaced amphid neurons, and <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=vab-1" role="_blank">vab-1</ulink></emphasis> mutants, which have malformed heads.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Bacillus thuringiensis</emphasis> (<emphasis>Bt</emphasis>) is a Gram-positive bacterium used in insect control because it makes toxins that do not affect vertebrates. <emphasis>Bt</emphasis> expressing a single pore-forming toxin, Cry5B, causes intestinal damage to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> in a manner that resembles the pathology observed in toxin-treated insects (<link linkend="bib34">Marroquin et al., 2000</link><!-- PMID 10924467 -->). The animals turn pale, the intestine becomes pitted, vacuolated and constricted, and brood size is reduced. There are no obvious effects on the neuromuscular systems of the worm. Expression of Cry5B in <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> recapitulated these results, indicating that the damage is toxin-specific, not a general response to <emphasis>Bt</emphasis>.</para>

      <title><emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis></title>
      <para><emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> kills <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> in two distinct toxin-mediated modes. In the first, known as "fast killing,"  bacterial strain PA14 is used, and a high osmolarity medium is required (<link linkend="bib32">Mahajan-Miklos et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 9989496 -->). At least 50%, and in some assays about 90%, of L4 animals died within 4 h of exposure. Killing is mediated by diffusible toxins and does not require contact with live bacteria.</para>
      <para>A screen of 3,300 <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> transposon insertions produced seven mutants with reduced killing (<link linkend="bib32">Mahajan-Miklos et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 9989496 -->). Four mutants had reduced levels of pyocyanin, a pigmented secondary metabolite belonging to the phenazine family of tricyclic compounds. However, three killing-defective mutants made normal amounts of pyocyanin. Together, these results suggest that toxicity is multifactoral, involving pyocyanin (or other phenazines) and unidentified other molecules.</para>
      <para>Pyocyanin is a redox-active compound toxic to eukaryotic cells, suggesting that fast killing is due at least in part to oxidative stress. Analysis of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> mutants lent support to this hypothesis. <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=age-1" role="_blank">age-1</ulink></emphasis> mutants, which are resistant to other forms of oxidative stress, were significantly resistant to fast killing (<link linkend="bib32">Mahajan-Miklos et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 9989496 -->). Conversely, <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=mev-1" role="_blank">mev-1</ulink></emphasis> and <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=rad-8" role="_blank">rad-8</ulink></emphasis> mutants, which are hypersensitive to oxidative stress, were more sensitive in fast-killing assays.</para>
      <para>The <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> genes <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=pgp-1" role="_blank">pgp-1</ulink></emphasis> and <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=pgp-3" role="_blank">pgp-3</ulink></emphasis> encode P-glycoprotein membrane transporters. A <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=pgp-1" role="_blank">pgp-1</ulink></emphasis>;<emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=pgp-3" role="_blank">pgp-3</ulink></emphasis> double mutant was sensitive to fast killing without the need for high osmolarity (<link linkend="bib32">Mahajan-Miklos et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 9989496 -->). Furthermore, the double mutant was hypersensitive to <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> mutants that retained phenazine production, but was as resistant as wild type to phenazine-deficient mutants.</para>
      <para>The second toxin-mediated killing model uses a different <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> strain, PAO1. When PAO1 is grown to high density on an especially rich medium, animals placed on the lawn cease pharyngeal pumping almost instantaneously, become progressively paralyzed, and die within two hours (<link linkend="bib10">Darby et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 10611362 -->). These effects are mediated by bacterially produced cyanide, a toxin that blocks respiratory electron transport (<link linkend="bib15">Gallagher and Manoil, 2001</link><!-- PMID 11591663 -->).</para>
      <para>In a screen for <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> resistant to cyanide-mediated killing, two alleles of <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=egl-9" role="_blank">egl-9</ulink></emphasis> were recovered (<link linkend="bib10">Darby et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 10611362 -->). Although <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=egl-9" role="_blank">egl-9</ulink></emphasis> worms were completely resistant to killing by live bacteria, dose-response experiments <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> showed that the mutants can be killed by sufficiently high cyanide  concentrations (<link linkend="bib15">Gallagher and Manoil, 2001</link><!-- PMID 11591663 -->). <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=egl-9" role="_blank">egl-9</ulink></emphasis> encodes a dioxygenase that functions as a negative regulator of a hypoxia-response pathway (<link linkend="bib13">Epstein et al., 2001</link><!-- PMID 11595184 -->). This suggests that in <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=egl-9" role="_blank">egl-9</ulink></emphasis>  mutants, cyanide resistance is mediated by constitutive activation of the pathway. The role of cyanide in human <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> infections, if any, is not known.</para>

Other Streptococci that kill <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> with hydrogen peroxide include <emphasis>S. pyogenes</emphasis> (also known as group A Streptococcus) and <emphasis>S. agalactiae</emphasis> (group B; <link linkend="bib6">Bolm et al., 2004</link><!-- PMID 14742574 -->).</para>

      <title>Expression of bacterial effectors in transgenic <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis></title>
      <para>Pathogenic bacteria produce a wide variety of effectors that act on the host, and often the targets have conserved eukaryotic functions. Organisms that produce these effectors nevertheless may not be pathogenic to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> because disease requires a variety of other functions, e.g. sensing of the host environment, gene induction, binding to host receptors, and evasion of host defenses. A strategy to overcome these limitations is to express bacterial effectors directly in transgenic <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. This approach was demonstrated using pertussis toxin (PTX), a well-characterized effector known to enzymatically inactivate a class of heterotrimeric G proteins. Expression of PTX produced a phenotype indistinguishable from that of loss-of-function mutations in <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=goa-1" role="_blank">goa-1</ulink></emphasis>, which encodes the only PTX target in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib11">Darby and Falkow, 2001</link><!-- PMID 11553570 -->). PTX expression also suppressed a gain-of-function <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=goa-1" role="_blank">goa-1</ulink></emphasis> mutation.</para>
      <para>A mutation in the <emphasis>Salmonella enterica</emphasis> gene <emphasis>sptP</emphasis> was recovered in a screen for mutants with defects in killing <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib44">Tenor et al., 2004</link><!-- PMID 15182677 -->). In mammals, SptP is injected into host cells, where it reverses cytoskeletal disruption produced earlier by another <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> effector (<link linkend="bib14">Fu and Galan, 1999</link><!-- PMID 10499590 -->). Transgenic animals were generated with <emphasis>sptP</emphasis> under the promoter of the intestinal gene <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=mtl-2" role="_blank">mtl-2</ulink></emphasis>. The animals were then exposed to either <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> or <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>infection to determine whether ectopic expression of SptP enhances pathogenicity. In both cases a slight increase was observed in relative mortality (ratio of LT<subscript>50</subscript> on pathogen to LT<subscript>50</subscript> on <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>) compared to untransformed controls.</para>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <para>The first paper describing <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> as a model host for a microbial pathogen was published in 1999. The field has grown rapidly since, and now investigates a diverse range of human pathogens that includes numerous bacteria and one fungus. Several microbes that are pathogenic to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> but not to humans also are being examined.</para>
      <para>As a rapidly growing, inexpensive host, <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> permits large-scale screens of pathogen genomes, and thousands of bacterial mutants have been tested in screens of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib15">Gallagher and Manoil, 2001</link><!-- PMID 11591663 -->; <link linkend="bib32">Mahajan-Miklos et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 9989496 -->; <link linkend="bib43">Tan et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 10051655 -->), <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib16">Gan et al., 2002</link><!-- PMID 12068805 -->), <emphasis>S. marcescens</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib30">Kurz et al., 2003</link><!-- PMID 12660152 -->) and <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib4">Bae et al., 2004</link><!-- PMID 15304642 -->). Some of the mutations recovered have been in virulence genes already known from mammalian studies, which validates the screening strategy (<link linkend="bib4">Bae et al., 2004</link><!-- PMID 15304642 -->; <link linkend="bib30">Kurz et al., 2003</link><!-- PMID 12660152 -->; <link linkend="bib39">Sifri et al., 2003</link><!-- PMID 12654843 -->; <link linkend="bib42">Tan et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 10051655 -->; <link linkend="bib44">Tenor et al., 2004</link><!-- PMID 15182677 -->).</para>
      <para>The ultimate goal is to discover new virulence factors for mammalian pathogenesis, and here results have been mixed. Some of the <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib43">Tan et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 10051655 -->) and <emphasis>B. pseudomallei</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib16">Gan et al., 2002</link><!-- PMID 12068805 -->) mutants defective against <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> were also attenuated in a mouse models. On the other hand, no new mammalian virulence mutants were found in a screen of <emphasis>S. marcescens</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib30">Kurz et al., 2003</link><!-- PMID 12660152 -->), and investigators who screened <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> concluded that for this pathogen, there is limited overlap between <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> and mammalian pathogenesis (<link linkend="bib4">Bae et al., 2004</link><!-- PMID 15304642 -->).</para>
      <para>With infection models, some screens for bacterial mutant appear biased toward identifying regulators. For instance, five of eight <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> mutations in the slow killing model were in genes known or inferred to encode regulators (<link linkend="bib43">Tan et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 10051655 -->). This suggests that slow killing is multifactoral, and that regulators are identified because mutations disrupt expression of several downstream factors. Screens in a multifactoral system may not have sufficient resolution to identify individual effectors. However, this drawback may be pathogen-specific, because a screen of <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> produced a mutation in <emphasis>sptP</emphasis>, which is known from mammalian studies to encode an effector that acts in the cytoplasm of host cells (<link linkend="bib44">Tenor et al., 2004</link><!-- PMID 15182677 -->).</para>
      <para>In toxin-mediated killing models, screens of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> have proven useful in characterizing the toxins. A mutation in the bacterial <emphasis>hcnC</emphasis> gene, encoding hydrogen cyanide synthase, prompted experiments showing that cyanide is necessary and sufficient for lethal paralysis (<link linkend="bib15">Gallagher and Manoil, 2001</link><!-- PMID 11591663 -->). In the fast-killing model,  mutations in <emphasis>phzB</emphasis> prompted further investigation of phenazines as candidate toxins (<link linkend="bib32">Mahajan-Miklos et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 9989496 -->).</para>
      <para>On the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> side of the interaction, genetics can provide information about the host pathways that pathogens exploit. A notable success is the work of Aroian and colleagues on <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> mutants resistant to a <emphasis>Bt</emphasis> toxin. The screen identified a set of glycosyltransferases that function together in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib20">Griffitts et al., 2003</link><!-- PMID 12944392 -->; <link linkend="bib21">Griffitts et al., 2001</link><!-- PMID 11486087 -->; <link linkend="bib34">Marroquin et al., 2000</link><!-- PMID 10924467 -->), and this in turn facilitated identification of a glycolipid toxin receptor (<link linkend="bib19">Griffitts et al., 2005</link><!-- PMID 15705852 -->). However, screens to find resistant organisms do not always identify the pathways that interact directly with the pathogen. A screen for worms resistant to <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> paralysis produced alleles of <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=egl-9" role="_blank">egl-9</ulink></emphasis> (<link linkend="bib10">Darby et al., 1999</link><!-- PMID 10611362 -->); later characterization suggested that the resistance phenotype results from activation of a bypass pathway (<link linkend="bib13">Epstein et al., 2001</link><!-- PMID 11595184 -->).</para>
      <para>Because <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> models for microbial pathogenesis are still new, the extent to which they are relevant to human disease remains to be determined. Obviously the overlap will not be complete, but this is true for any animal model. It is encouraging that some virulence gene discovered using <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> have been found to be required for full pathogenesis in mouse infections. These genes have not yet been characterized thoroughly, however. The task ahead is to take novel results from <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> systems and determine their importance in human infectious disease.</para>
