         <title>Figure 3. Biofilms on head formed by <emphasis>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</emphasis> after one hour (left) or overnight (right) incubation on bacterial lawns</title>
         <para>Nematodes were washed in M9 buffer before mounting for confocal epifluorescence microscopy. <emphasis>Yersinia</emphasis> cells express GFP; non-fluorescent material adhering to the head is bacterially-synthesized extracellular polysaccharide. Note that polysaccharide covers the mouth at one hour. Photo: Creg Darby.</para>
