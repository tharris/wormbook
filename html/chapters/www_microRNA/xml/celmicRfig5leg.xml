        <para> miRNAs use two mechanisms to exert gene regulation. Some
            animal miRNAs can bind to mRNA targets with exact complementarity and induce the RNAi
            pathway. miRNAs also bind to targets with imperfect complementarity and block
            translation. There is no evidence that <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> miRNAs use the
            former pathway.</para>
