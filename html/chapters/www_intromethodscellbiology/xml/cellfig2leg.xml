<title>Figure 2.</title>
<para>The top three panels show polarized light microscopy of adult body wall muscle from wild type and from two muscle-affecting mutants. Each image was captured with a 40X objective and shows portions of about three muscle cells. The inset shows an enlarged view. Wild type muscle shows a high degree of organization with birefringent A-bands alternating with dark I-bands, each containing a row of dense bodies. <emphasis>unc-89(su75)</emphasis> exhibits the phenotype of a typical <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=unc-89" role="_blank">unc-89</ulink></emphasis> mutant: reduced organization of the myofilament lattice with an almost &#x0201C;basketweave&#x0201D; pattern. <emphasis>unc-98(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=sf19;class=Variation" role="_blank">sf19</ulink>)</emphasis> displays disorganized myofibrils with characteristic birefringent &#x0201C;needles&#x0201D; at the ends of the muscle cells. The bottom panel is an illustration showing the position of the four muscle quadrants (right) and a portion of a single muscle cell emphasizing the myofilament lattice. The oval indicates the plane of view seen by polarized light (Denise Flaherty and Guy Benian).</para>
