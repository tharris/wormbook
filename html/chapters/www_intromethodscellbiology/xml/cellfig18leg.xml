<para>Profiling GFP-labeled embryonic cells. Intact embryos are isolated from gravid adults by hypochlorite treatment. 1. Treatment with chitinase releases embryonic blastomeres. 2. Cells marked with GFP reporters expressed in early embryos (i.e., before morphogenesis at ~400 min) are isolated by FACS (e.g. <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=myo-3" role="_blank">myo-3</ulink>::GFP</emphasis> body muscle cells) (Green arrows). 3. Alternatively, dissociated blastomeres can be cultured for 24 hr to generate GFP-labeled cells that emerge later in embryonic development (e.g. <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=unc-4" role="_blank">unc-4</ulink>::GFP</emphasis> in DA motor neurons) (brown arrows). 4. GFP-marked cells are isolated by FACS and RNA extracted for application to the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> Affymetrix Gene Chip. 5. (Rebecca M. Fox, Susan J. Ruff, and David M.
