<para>Assessing quality of RNA amplified from cultured cells for gene array hybridization. A. The prefragmented RNA should show a broad size distribution (X-axis). Smaller fragments should be more abundant (Y-axis, arrow), as the amplification process is biased to the 3&apos; end. The gel image should be a large smear, with no intense high molecular weight products. Fragmented RNA should be 200 bp or less. B. These plots demonstrate a sample that is not hybridizable. The prefragmented RNA distribution includes a long tail indicative of non-template dependent high molecular weight products (open arrow). The presence of unfragmented peaks are evident (arrowhead). For patterns like this, we either repeat the amplification/fragmentation or discard that RNA sample (Steve Von Stetina, Rebecca Fox, and David Miller).</para>
