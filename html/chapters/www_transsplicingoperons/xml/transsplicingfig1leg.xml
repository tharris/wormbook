        <title>Figure 1. Comparison of cis- and trans-splicing</title>
	<para>In cis-splicing, the U1 snRNP base pairs with the 5' splice site, and U2 snRNP base
            pairs with the branchpoint near the 3' splice site. The intron is excised and the two
            exons are spliced together. In trans-splicing there is no 5' splice site on the pre-mRNA
            for U1 snRNP binding. Instead, the 5' splice site is provided by the donor SL snRNP,
            which interacts with the U2 snRNP at the 3' splice site, and the SL exon is spliced to
            the exon on the pre-mRNA. The region between the 5' cap and the trans-splice site is
            called the outron. CBC: nuclear cap binding complex.</para>
