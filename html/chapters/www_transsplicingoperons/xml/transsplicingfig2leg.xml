        <title>Figure 2. Two types of operons in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis></title>
        <para>Almost all <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> operons are of the SL2-type, shown above.
            The site of 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation of the upstream gene is determined by
            the AAUAAA signal, indicated by the black bar. The Ur element serves to protect the
            downstream RNA from degradation following 3' end cleavage, as well as to attract the SL2
            snRNP. Most operons of this type have about 100 bp between the cleavage and
            polyadenylation site of the upstream gene and the trans-splice site to which SL2 is
            spliced. A few <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> operons are of the SL1-type, where the
            site at which 3' cleavage and polyadenylation occurs is also the trans-splice site for
            the downstream gene, so the intercistronic distance is effectively zero. These operons
            are always trans-spliced by the SL1 snRNP.</para>
