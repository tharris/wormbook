        <para>The interactions among eIF1, eIF2, eIF3, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF5, Mnk, PABP, mRNA, and the 40S ribosomal subunit are shown. The thin line represents mRNA, with the wavy line indicating mRNA secondary structure. Met<subscript>i</subscript> is the initiator tRNA. The sizes of protein depictions are roughly proportion to their molecular masses.</para>
