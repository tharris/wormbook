<para>SynMuv A and SynMuv B are the major groups in this pathway that are redundantly required for vulval development.  The relationship of these pathways with the SynMuv C pathway are less clear.  Within the SynMuv B group, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=LIN-53;class=Protein" role="_blank">LIN-53</ulink>, marked with an asterisk, is listed twice, as it is found in both NuRD and DRM complexes.</para>
