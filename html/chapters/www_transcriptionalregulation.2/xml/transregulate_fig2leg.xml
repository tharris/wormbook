<title><emphasis role="bold">Figure 2: Metazoan regulatory modules controlling transcription.</emphasis></title>
<para>Shown is a diagram of a typical metazoan gene illustrating the complex interactions among <emphasis>cis</emphasis>-acting modules and <emphasis>trans</emphasis>-acting factors regulating gene expression.  Note that both positive and negative control regions are interspersed with promoter modules, all of which can be further influenced by distal regions regulating chromatin configuration, such as insulators.
