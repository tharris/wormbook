<para>RNAPII (including the extended CTD with SerPO4 knobs) is purple; the globular and CTD portions are drawn approximately to scale for mammalian RNAPII.  Orange DNA is wrapped around yellow nucleosomal histones; nucleosomes modified by Set2 are shaded darker. The nascent RNA transcript is green. Yeast names are used for PCAPs (e.g., <link linkend="bib180">Phatnani and Greenleaf, 2006</link><!--; PMID 17079683-->), not all of which are shown. (CBC) cap-binding complex; (CRF) chromatin remodeling factor; (XF) processing/export factor.
