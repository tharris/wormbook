<para>Motif composition of the <emphasis>Caenorhabditis</emphasis> core promoter. (A) Five conserved motifs in each of the five examined <emphasis>Caenorhabditis</emphasis> species are shown as sequence logos. (*) In contrast to all other motifs that were found in the initial search, the <emphasis>Caenorhabditis japonica</emphasis> TATA box motif was detected only in sequences whose orthologs contained the &ldquo;TATA&rdquo; motif. (B) Distribution of motifs relative to the translational start codon. The gray box in each plot corresponds to the core promoter.  The area under the curve is the total frequency of occurrence within the core promoter region with the line indicating the frequency at each position as indicated by the scale to the left.  The <emphasis>C. japonica</emphasis> SL1 motif was normalized to the length of the other species. (C)  Frequency table for each sequence motif.
