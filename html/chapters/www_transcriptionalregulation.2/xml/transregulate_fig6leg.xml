<para>The X axis represents a stretch of Chr IV from nt 12,341,610 to 12,472,625.  Coding genes are shown below, with arrows marking the direction of transcription 5'&rarr;3'.  The Y axis represents the z-score of the log 2 ratios of IP/Input (mean centered and scaled to stdev=1).  Note the opposing pattern of H3K27me, a mark associated with gene silencing, with that of activation marks such as H3K4me and H3K36me.  Image courtesy of Susan Strome and Andreas Rechsteiner.</para>
