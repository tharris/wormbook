<para>(A-D) Representative frames showing expression of mCherry reporters for the indicated transcription factors (red) ovelayed on ubiquitous histone::gfp reporter expression marking all nuclei.  Anterior is left.  (E) Embryonic lineage trees showing expression of the indicated transcription factor::mCherry transgenes (colored), or a merged image showing expression of all four transgenes.  This data was acquired and visualized using StarryNite and AceTree (<link linkend="bib161">Murray et al., 2008</link><!--; PMID 18587405-->).  Panels A-D were acquired from movies at http://epic.gs.washington.edu/.  Panel E was adapted with permission from <link linkend="bib161">Murray et al., 2008</link><!--; PMID 18587405-->.</para>
