        <para>(A) Collagens in vertebrates have been demonstrated to form propeptide homo- or
            heteromeric helical trimers. Trimer formation is preceded by the association of the
            cysteine containing domains that are specific for each family of collagen. The
            association of the cysteine domains also puts the monomers in the right registration for
            trimer formation, which is carried out by the Gly-X-Y repeats in a zipping fashion
            starting from the C-terminal end. (B) The helical trimer propeptide is further processed
            by protease cleavage of the N-terminus by BLI-4 (in SQT-3 the C-terminus may also be a
            site of propeptide cleavage; <link linkend="bib39">Novelli et al., 2004</link><!-- ; PMID 15579684 -->). After proteolytic
            processing, the trimers are cross-linked to other trimers via N-terminal and C-terminal
            cross-linking sites to form the collagen matrix.</para>
