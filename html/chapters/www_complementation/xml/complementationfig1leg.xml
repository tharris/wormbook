        <title>Figure 1. The complementation test</title>
        <para><emphasis>m1</emphasis> and <emphasis>m2</emphasis> are fictional alleles representing recessive mutations. Historical Note: The <emphasis>cis</emphasis>-<emphasis>trans</emphasis> test. In a more rigorous application of the complementation test; if the mutations do not complement one another when they are present in the <emphasis>trans</emphasis> configuration, the mutations should then be combined in <emphasis>cis</emphasis> and tested over the wild-type allele (<link linkend="bib45">Pontecorvo, 1958</link>). In this case, the <emphasis>cis</emphasis> heterozygote should exhibit a wild-type phenotype. If a mutant phenotype is still observed, then the <emphasis>trans</emphasis> complementation test was leading you to the wrong conclusion. The correct conclusion is that the mutations do not define alleles of the same gene, rather they are exhibiting non-allelic non-complementation (see text). This result is rare and the <emphasis>cis</emphasis> test is not usually performed and may be quite difficult to carry out.</para>
