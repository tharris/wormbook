        <para>(A) LIN-3 is required in at least four processes, viability, vulval development, male spicule development and hermaphrodite  fertility. <emphasis>lin-3</emphasis> alleles exhibit a different allelic series for each process, suggesting that each process has a different, independently regulated requirement for LIN-3. Adapted from <link linkend="bib29">Liu et al., 1999</link><!--; PMID 10545457-->. (B) Domain structure of LIN-3 and location of the lesions in <emphasis>lin-3</emphasis> alleles. SP-signal peptide cleavage site, EGF-epidermal growth factor domain, TM-transmembrane domain, dotted vertical lines-intron boundries. Adapted from <link linkend="bib29">Liu et al., 1999</link>.  Information for <emphasis>e1417</emphasis> is from <link linkend="bib20">Hwang and Sternberg, 2004</link><!--; PMID 14660442-->.</para>
