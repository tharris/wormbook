        <para>(A) Intragenic complementation of <emphasis>eat-2</emphasis> alleles. The number of alleles in each class is noted in parentheses below the class letter along the bottom row. Intragenic complementation results are highlighted in yellow. *These trans-heterozygotes are not fully wild-type; however, thay are less defective than either homozygote.  Data was extrapolated from <link linkend="bib46">Raizen et al. (1995<!-- ; PMID 8601480 -->)</link>. (B) A schematic of the EAT-2 subunit with approximate locations of the mutations that can complement other <emphasis>eat-2</emphasis> mutations
            (highlighted in yellow). Class A non-complementing mutations are highlighted in purple.
            Data extrapolated from <link linkend="bib33">McKay et al. (2004<!-- ; PMID 15020415 -->)</link>. Abbreviations: Pmp-Pumping defective.</para>
