		<title>Figure 3. Metabolic flux in microaerobic conditions.</title>
		<para>In the diagram, only the formation of (G)ATP is indicated (not its consumption). This diagram is primarily based on the work of <link linkend="bib105">McElwee et al. (2006</link><!--: PMID 16522328-->), <link linkend="bib63">Holt and Riddle (2003</link><!--: PMID 12875742-->), and <link linkend="bib25">Burnell et al., (2005</link><!--: PMID 16221538-->). Note that LDH activity is increased in hypoxia only; LDH expression level is lowered in the dauer stage.</para>
