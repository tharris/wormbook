<title>Figure 1. NRs assemble activation and repressive complexes.</title>
<para>Typical type 2 NRs such as PPAR&gamma; bind to hormone response elements (HRE), and when ligand bound (e.g., fibrates) activate transcription by recruiting co-activator complexes (PGC-1, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE49528;class=Protein" role="_blank">SRC-1</ulink>), histone acetylase complexes (<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00095109;class=Variation" role="_blank">p300</ulink>), methylase complexes (e.g., CARM), chromatin remodeling complexes (SWI/SNF), and mediator subunits (TRAP/DRIP). In the absence of their ligands, NRs recruit co-repressor complexes (NCoR, RIP140) to repress transcription through the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDAC), histone demethylases, and other repressive components, and to inhibit TRAP/DRIP complexes.
