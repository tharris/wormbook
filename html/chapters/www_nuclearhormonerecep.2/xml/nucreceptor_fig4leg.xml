<title>Figure 4. Bile acid-like biosynthetic pathways show conserved features between worms and mammals.</title>
<para>In <emphasis>C. elegans,</emphasis> dietary cholesterol is modified via a series of enzymes to give the various DAs, including &Delta;4-DA, &Delta;7-DA, &Delta;1,7-DA, and 3-alphahydroxy-DA. (Modifications highlighted in color). DAs regulate <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE27584;class=Protein" role="_blank">DAF-12</ulink>, a worm homolog of the bile acid receptor FXR. A related <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> receptor, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE33928;class=Protein" role="_blank">NHR-8</ulink>, regulates the first step in DA synthesis, the conversion of cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol by the <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE34156;class=Protein" role="_blank">DAF-36</ulink>/Rieske oxygenase. Ligands for <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE33928;class=Protein" role="_blank">NHR-8</ulink> are unknown but surmised to be sterols. In mammals, major bile acids such as chenodeoxycholic acid regulate the transcriptional activity of mammalian FXR. In response to its oxysterol ligands, LXR controls cholesterol and bile acid flux, regulating the first step in the pathway, the conversion of cholesterol to 7-hydroxycholesterol by CYP7A1. Several similarities are seen in the chemistry of bile acid-like steroid production in worms and mammals.</para>
