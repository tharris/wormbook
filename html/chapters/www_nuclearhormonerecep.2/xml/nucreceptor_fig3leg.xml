<para>In <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, cGMP, TGF-&beta;, and IIS activate steroidal signaling to promote maturation through <emphasis>let-7s</emphasis> expression. Reduction of these endocrine pathways result in maturational arrest and longevity (i.e., dauer). Similarly in flies the convergence of PTTH (prothoraciotropic hormone), TGF-&beta;, and IIS activate ecdysone signaling resulting in metamorphosis and maturation. Ecdysteroid signaling activates <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00002285;class=Gene" role="_blank">let-7</ulink></emphasis> microRNAs in some tissues. Downregulation of IIS and ecdysone is associated with longevity. In mammals, gonadotropins, TGF-&beta;/Activin, and IIS stimulate maturational steroids. Steroid receptors may also be involved in promoting <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00002285;class=Gene" role="_blank">let-7</ulink></emphasis> and other maturational microRNAs. Reduced IIS is associated with mammalian longevity.</para>
