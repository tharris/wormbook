		<para>The non-feeding IJ stage, a dauer juvenile (DJ) stage that infects insects, exists in soil containing a monoculture of symbiotic bacteria in its intestinal lumen, sometimes for many months until an insect host is found. The DJs locate an insect host and enter the hemocoel, where they regurgitate symbiotic bacteria. The bacteria rapidly kill the insect and produce metabolites to inhibit microbial, nematode and arthropod competitors. After 2&#x02013;3 generations, DJs are again formed and emerge en masse transmitting symbiotic bacteria. Adapted from <link linkend="bib11">Ciche et al.
