	<para>(A) Gateway recombination is used to clone the promoter and coding region for a gene of interest (G.O.I) into p221 using the BP reaction, and from p221 into pSB_GW::TAG using the LR reaction. An example of this is shown on the right in which universal primers have been used to PCR amplify the promotor and coding region (P&#x0002B;C) for <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=Y41E3.9;class=Gene" role="_blank">Y41E3.9</ulink> from pSB_Y41E3.9::TAG (B) Microparticle bombardment is used to integrate the construct into <emphasis>unc-119(ed3)</emphasis> mutants at low copy to generate a transgenic line expressing the protein of interest (P.O.I.) fused to C-terminal epitope tags. The transgenic line is grown to high density in a BioFlo5000&#x000AE; fermenter, harvested and extracts generated for purification purposes(C). Tandem immuno-affinity chromatography over protein-A-MAb12CA5 and then protein-A-MAb9E10 is used to purify the P.O.I.-associated protein complex, before complex components are identified by mass-spectrometry. An example on the right shows a silver stained 4&#x02013;12&#x00025; gradient gel comparing the mock purification after (1.) HA and (2.) HA &#x0002B; Myc to the (3.) <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=Y41E3.9;class=Gene" role="_blank">Y41E3.9</ulink> associated protein complex after HA &#x0002B; MYC immunoaffinity.</para>
