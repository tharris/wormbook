        <title>Figure 3. Summary of MEX-3 and PAL-1 localization data in wild-type, mutant, and RNAi
            depleted embryos</title>
        <para>These data show that MEX-3 localization and MEX-3 activity can be modulated
            independently, thus parallel pathways regulate the pattern of PAL-1 accumulation.
