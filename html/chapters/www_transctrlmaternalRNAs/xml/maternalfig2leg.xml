        <title>Figure 2. Model for localized translation of Notch/GLP-1</title>
        <para>In the posterior, GLD-1 and POS-1 accumulate and repress <emphasis>glp-1</emphasis> mRNA (wavy blue line).
            In the anterior, GLD-1 and POS-1 expression is repressed; POS-1 is degraded by a process
            requiring MEX-5/6 (Reese et al., 2000<!--; PMID 10983990-->; Schubert et al., 2000<!--; PMID
            10882103 -->). In addition, a derepressor directly inhibits residual GLD-1/POS-1 complexes
            in the anterior to promote translation. The derepressor factor is unknown (?), but the
            RNA binding proteins SPN-4 and MEX-5/6 are candidate components.</para>
