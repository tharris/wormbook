        <para>Dorsal intercalation in a wild-type embryo visualized using Nomarski microscopy
            (<link linkend="bib78">Williams-Masson et al., 1998</link><!--; PMID 9851858-->). Cells become wedge-shaped as they begin
            intercalation, and eventually adopt a ladder-like arrangement straddling the dorsal
            midline. Anterior to the left, dorsal view. Frames were acquired at 30 sec intervals.
