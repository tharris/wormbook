        <title>Figure 1. Developmental timing of morphogenetic events</title>
        <para>Developmental landmarks are shown with representative Nomarski Differential
            Interference Contrast (DIC) images of embryos at corresponding stages, based on Figure 4
            of Sulston et al. 1983 (<link linkend="bib73">Sulston et al., 1983</link><!--; PMID 6684600-->). Developmental times are
            relative to the division of the zygote (P<subscript>0</subscript>), in minutes at
                20<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol>C; rates at 25<symbol
            role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> are 1.2 times faster than at 20<symbol
            role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol>C; rates at 15<symbol
            role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol>C are 1.5 times slower than at 20<symbol
            role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol>C. Fertilization occurs ~45 minutes before
            P<subscript>0</subscript> divides. The stage termed ‘lima bean’ has not been precisely
            defined but is roughly equivalent to the period of epidermal enclosure when the ventral
            side of the embryo first becomes visibly concave. Note that unequal growth along the
            anteroposterior axis forces the embryo to turn within the eggshell between 350 and 400
            minutes so that either the left or right side is uppermost, when mounted for
            observation; images before turning are either ventral or dorsal views, whereas
            afterwards they are left or right lateral views. All laterally viewed embryos in this
            and subsequent figures are oriented with anterior to the left, posterior to the right.</para>
