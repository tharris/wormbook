<para>Nomarski DIC images (courtesy H.N. Cinar and D. Patel) and schematics of ventral neuroblast positions during closure of the ventral cleft in the wild type; see also <xref linkend="movie1"/>. The left column includes schematics of ventral views of embryos with the migrating neuroblasts shown in green. The right column includes DIC images or embryos at the corresponding stage. Although the movements of individual cells during ventral cleft closure have not been fully described, the presence of a ventral cleft is well defined and its duration can be quantitated (M. L. Hudson and A.D.C., unpublished results). Scale, 10 <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x003BC;</symbol>m.</para>
