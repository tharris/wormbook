        <para>Ventral cleft closure in a wild-type embryo visualized using Nomarski microscopy.
            Anterior to the left, ventral view. Ventrolateral neuroblasts move towards the ventral
            midline and close the cleft from posterior to anterior. Frames were acquired at 60 sec
            intervals. Original movie footage courtesy of H.N. Cinar and D. Patel (unpublished).
