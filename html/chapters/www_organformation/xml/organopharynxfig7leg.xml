		<title>Figure 7. Pharyngeal morphogenesis</title>
<para>Left panels depict stages of Reorientation (A to B, Stage 1), Epithelialization (B to C, Stage 2) and Contraction (C to D, Stage 3). Yellow cells denote arcade cells, which are initially mesenchymal (A, B), but later become epithelialized (C, D). Green cells represent cells in the pharyngeal primordium. Right panels show midstage embryos stained for cell periphery (red, <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x003B1;</symbol>UNC-70) and adherens junctions (green, MH27), merge is yellow. The basement membrane surrounding the pharynx is denoted by a dotted yellow line in both sets of panels.</para>
