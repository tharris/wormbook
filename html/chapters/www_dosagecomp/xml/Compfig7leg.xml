	<para>The <emphasis>C. elegans.</emphasis> X chromosome 
harbors multiple X-recognition elements (<emphasis>rex</emphasis> sites) that distinguish 
it from autosomes to recruit the dosage compensation complex. The 
complex binds to <emphasis>rex</emphasis> elements on both 
hermaphrodite X chromosomes and then spreads in 
<emphasis>cis</emphasis> to neighboring X regions that lack 
recruitment sites, thus establishing X-chromosome-wide repression 
that is maintained throughout the lifetime of the animal.</para>
