X-recognition element</title>
	<para>(A)  Strategy for isolating X-recognition elements that 
recruit the dosage compensation complex. Transgenic nematodes were 
created that carried extrachromosomal arrays made of X DNA, 
<emphasis>lac</emphasis> operator sequences, and a gene encoding the 
<emphasis>lac</emphasis> repressor-GFP bifunctional fusion protein. 
<emphasis>lac</emphasis> repressor binds the <emphasis>lac</emphasis> 
operator sequences, allowing arrays to be detected by GFP fluorescence or antibodies (green, arrow). The dosage compensation 
complex is identified by antibodies to a dosage compensation protein 
(red), and the nuclear DNA by DAPI (blue). If X sequences contain an 
X-recognition element, dosage compensation protein antibodies will 
co-localize with the array. Within each nucleus, binding of the 
complex to both Xs serves as a staining control. (B)  Identification 
of <emphasis>rex-1</emphasis>. This strategy identified an 
X-recognition element (<emphasis>rex-1</emphasis>) from a region of X with limited ability to recruit the complex (see map in 
<xref linkend="figure6" />). Shown are two gut cells, one with an array carrying a 
4.5 kb piece of X DNA and one without. The dosage compensation 
complex binds to the array and titrates complexes from X. X 
chromosomes are readily detectable only in the cell that lacks the 
array.</para>
