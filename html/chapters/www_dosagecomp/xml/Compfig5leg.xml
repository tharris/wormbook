compensation complexes to X</title>
	<para>An X may contain one (1), several  (II and III) or 
numerous (IV) <emphasis>cis</emphasis>-acting recognition elements to 
recruit the complex. After initial binding, the complex may spread 
(I and II) or not spread (III and IV) along X chromosomes. Model I 
reflects mammalian X inactivation. Model II was thought to reflect 
fly dosage compensation, but recent evidence suggests that Model IV 
may more accurately reflect the fly mechanism. Model II reflects 
worm dosage compensation.</para>
