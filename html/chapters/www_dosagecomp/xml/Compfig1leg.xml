	<para>Organisms use different strategies to equalize X-linked 
gene expression between males (XY or XO) and females (or 
hermaphrodites; XX). Female mammals randomly inactivate one X 
chromosome. Male fruit flies double the transcription rate of their 
single X chromosome. Hermaphrodite worms half the expression of both 
X chromosomes.</para>
