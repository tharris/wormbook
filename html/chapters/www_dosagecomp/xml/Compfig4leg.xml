         <title>Figure 4. Multiple X regions recruit the dosage 
compensation complex and nucleate spreading</title>
	<para>(A-D) Confocal images of individual 32-ploid intestinal 
cell nuclei with (A-C) and without (D) X chromosome duplications 
detached from X. X-chromosome territories were marked by fluorescent 
in situ hybridization (FISH) probes; one identified the duplicated 
region (red), and a second identified the rest of X (blue). 
Localization of the dosage compensation complex was visualized by 
antibodies to a dosage compensation protein (green). Cartoons on 
left represent the genotype of each nucleus, showing the copy number 
of each X duplication (red) and the location on X (blue) of the 
duplicated region (red). Shown are regions of X that strongly 
recruited the complex (A), weakly recruited the complex (B), or 
failed to recruit the complex (C). Regions that did not recruit the 
complex when detached from X, exhibited robust recruitment of the 
dosage compensation when attached to the native X (D), indicating 
that the complexes spread to thes
regions from neighboring regions that
contained X recognition elements. Arrows mark duplications.</para>
