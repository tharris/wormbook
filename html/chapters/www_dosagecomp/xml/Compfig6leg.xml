         <title>Figure 6. Map of X regions that recruit the dosage 
compensation complex when detached from the native X</title>
	<para>Location of X regions that strongly (dark green), 
weakly (light green), or fail to (red) recruit the dosage 
compensation complex are shown relative to the gene-rich clusters 
(yellow) on X (blue) and the few known dosage compensated genes 
(<emphasis>uvt-4</emphasis>, <emphasis>lin-14</emphasis>, 
<emphasis>myo-2</emphasis>, <emphasis>lin-15</emphasis>) and 
non-dosage compensated genes (tRNA encoding genes 
<emphasis>sup-7</emphasis> and <emphasis>sup-21</emphasis>). Regions 
that apparently lack recruitment sites contain dosage compensated 
genes. This map summarizes DCC recruitment data obtained through 
experiments similar to those shown in <xref linkend="figure4"/>.</para>
