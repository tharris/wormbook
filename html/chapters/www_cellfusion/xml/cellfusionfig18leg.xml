            caused hypodermal tissue to be divided by membranes into 7 separate compartments,
            numbered here as h1-h7, of which only h1 and h2 face the cuticle directly. Unlike normal
            syncytial epidermis, where each <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=hyp;class=Cell" role="_blank">hyp</ulink> compartment is exposed to the cuticle, this portion
            of lateral epidermis has become stratified and the interior hypodermal cells show signs
            of autophagy (<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x2217;</symbol>
