        <para>(A) Ventral views of early-L1 (top) and mid-L1 (bottom) larvae. Six pairs of epidermal
            P blast cells initially lie along the ventral surface (top). During L1, the P cells
            migrate around each other so that a row of 12 P cells lines the ventral surface
            (bottom). Shortly after they migrate into the ventral cord, the P cells divide. The
            anterior (Pn.a) daughters become neuroblasts, while the posterior (Pn.p) daughters
            remain epidermal. Anterior is towards the left. (B) Lateral view of a late L1 larva with
            the 12 ventrally located Pn.p cells shown. Some of the Pn.p cells fuse with hyp7, which
            is located more dorsally along most of the mid-body region. (C, D) Pn.p cell fusion in
            wild-type hermaphrodite (C) and male (D). White circles indicate Pn.p cells that remain
            unfused, short horizontal lines indicate cells that fuse with the hyp7 syncytium. Hox
            gene expression domains are similar in both sexes, as indicated in hatched regions. The
            tables underneath show how Hox gene expression information is interpreted in the cell
            fusion decision. Reproduced from <link linkend="bib2">Alper and Kenyon (2002)</link><!--; PMID 12091304-->, Copyright
