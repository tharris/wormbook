        <para><emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=ref-2" role="_blank">ref-2</ulink></emphasis> gene function was inhibited by RNAi. A range of phenotypes was observed
            depending on the concentration of dsRNA injected. Weaker RNAi produced worms in which
            most of the Pn.p cells had fused (short horizontal lines), Stronger RNAi produced worms
            in which most of the Pn.p cells were absent from the ventral cord (A). White circles
            indicate unfused Pn.p cells. Pictured are data for hermaphrodites; similar phenotypes
            were also observed in males. Reproduced from <link linkend="bib3">Alper and Kenyon (2002)</link><!--; PMID 12091304-->,
