        <title>Figure 1. Cell fusion in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis></title>
        <para>Membranes of cells committed for fusion (gray color and dashed lines) fuse throughout
            development forming different syncytia (colored). White marks unfused cells. During
            embryonic elongation most of the dorsal cells, along with several ventral cells fuse to
            form the hypodermal syncytia (<link linkend="bib103">Podbilewicz and White, 1994</link><!--; PMID 8313992-->). More nuclei
            join these syncytia during larval development as a consequence of fusion of part of the
            lateral hypodermal seam cells, as well as part of the ventral epidermal cells. The
            resulting epidermis is comprised of 8 syncytia containing 186 nuclei (not shown) and
            only 3 unfused cells (for details, see <ulink url="http://www.wormatlas.org/"
                role="_blank">Wormatlas</ulink>). Other organs, such as the pharynx, excretory
            gland, uterus and vulva also contain syncytia (<link linkend="bib130">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</link>; <link linkend="bib131">Sulston et al., 1983</link><!--;
            PMID 6684600-->). During vulva organogenesis, cell fusion takes place between migrating
            cells (precursors of the vulA and vulC rings; violet and light blue, respectively), as
            well as between cells within the vulval rings (<link linkend="bib113">Sharma-Kishore et al., 1999</link><!--; PMID
            9895317-->). In total, 300 of 959 somatic nuclei in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> are
            part of syncytia (<link linkend="bib116">Shemer and Podbilewicz, 2000</link><!--; PMID 10822258-->). Reproduced from <link linkend="bib118">Shemer
