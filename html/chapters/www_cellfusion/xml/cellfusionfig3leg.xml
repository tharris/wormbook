        <para>(A) The coiled-coil domains of SNAREs bring vesicle and target membranes within close
            proximity, facilitating fusion. (B) In epidermal cell fusion in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, the apical
            junctions (AJ) hold the epidermal cells together where cell fusion is initiated. (C) A
            fusion pore forms at the apical junction of the membrane barrier and spreads outward
            behind the migrating junction. The two nuclei of the adjacent cells (N1, N2) share a
            common cytoplasm after fusion. Reproduced from <link linkend="bib143">Witze and Rothman (2002)</link><!--; PMID-->, Copyright
