		<title>Figure 1. Life cycle of <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis></title>
		<para>The diagram depicts the three possible developmental fates of hatchling first-stage larvae (L1 within the shaded box indicating the host). First, is the autoinfective cycle, unique to <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis>, in which development from the L1 to the autoinfective L3 (aL3) occurs within the gut of the primary host. Autoinfection can lead to fulminant cycles of development and a highly pathogenic disseminated infection. All postparasitic male L1 develop to free-living adult males. Postparasitic female L1 passed in the feces may undergo development by either of two alternative pathways. The homogonic cycle involves direct development to the infective L3 (iL3), and heterogonic development involves development to the free-living female and, following mating, production of a generation of free-living progeny. All progeny of the free-living adults develop to the iL3. Larval stages between the post-parasitic L1 and the aL3, iL3 or free-living adult as well as between the iL3 or aL3 and the parasitic female are omitted for the sake of clarity. Encircled numbers refer to stages that may be recovered using the culture protocols indicated in <link linkend="table1">Table 1</link>.</para>
