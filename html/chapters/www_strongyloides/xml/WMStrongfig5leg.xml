		<para>Cell bodies within the lateral ganglion (LG) are clearly visible just posterior to the nerve ring (NR). Dendritic processes of the amphidial cells converge in the amphidial channel (ACH). Following ablation of the target amphidial cell in this focal plane, the microscope and laser would be refocused on the other cell body in the neuron pair and this cell ablated as well.
