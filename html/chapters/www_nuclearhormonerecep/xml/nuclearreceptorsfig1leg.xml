        <para>(A) Schematic diagram of an exemplary nuclear hormone receptor. DNA binding domain
            (DNA) comprised of two Cys4 Zn fingers. Nine conserved cysteines are highlighted in red.
            A typical P-box, (CEGCKG) which confers DNA binding specificity, is shown. The ligand
            binding domain (ligand) contains multiple surfaces that recruit coactivators or
            corepressors. The AF-2 transactivation helix closes the ligand binding pocket during
            hormonal activation. (B) General model for transcriptional activation and repression
            based on vertebrate receptors. In the presence of hormone (triangle), NRs bind to their
            hormone response elements (HRE), and assemble coactivator complexes that acetylate (ac,
            p160, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=p300;class=Variation" role="_blank">p300</ulink>) or methylate (me, CARM1, PRMT1) nucleosomes (NUC). Mediator components
            contact NRs and facilitate the recruitment of the basal transcription machinery, turning
            on gene expression. Some nuclear receptors repress in the absence of hormone, by
            assembling corepressor complexes, such as SMRT and NCoR, which recruit histone
            deacetylases (HDACs) that inhibit transcription. The composition of activation and
            repression complexes depends on the NR as well as the promoter context. In addition,
            many NRs work as homo- or heterodimers.</para>
