        <title>Figure 5. P2-EMS Signaling</title>
        <para>Proteins functioning in the noncanonical Wnt pathway and interacting pathways that
            mediate the P2 signal to EMS are shown. Homologous vertebrate protein names or
            descriptions are shown in parenthesis. The MIG-14/MOM-3 locus has not been identified
            yet, but acts in P2. Active kinases are shown in red. The two horizontal lines indicate
            the plasma membrane of the signaling cell P2 (top line) and of EMS (bottom line).
            Question marks indicate that the point at which the MES-1/SRC-1 pathway interacts with
            the Wnt pathway is not yet known. A dashed arrow indicates that Wnt binding may also
            activate the MOM-4/LIT-1 pathway.</para>
