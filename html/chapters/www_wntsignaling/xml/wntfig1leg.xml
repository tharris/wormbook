        <para>In the absence of signal, action of the destruction complex (CKI<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;</symbol>, GSK3<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B2;</symbol>, APC, Axin)
            creates a hyperphosphorylated <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B2;</symbol>-catenin, which is a target for ubiqitination and
            degradation by the proteosome. Binding of Wnt ligand to a Frizzled/LRP-5/6 receptor
            complex leads to stabilization of hypophosphorylated <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B2;</symbol>-catenin, which interacts with
            TCF/LEF proteins in the nucleus to activate transcription. In a canonical pathway, CKI<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;</symbol>,
            GSK3<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B2;</symbol>, APC, and Axin act as negative regulators and all other components act positively.
