        <title>Figure 4. P2-EMS Signaling</title>
        <para>The top line shows the four blastomeres at the four cell stage of embryogenesis, and
            an arrow indicates the P2 to EMS signal required for endoderm induction. The bottom line
            shows the two daughters of the EMS division. In wild-type, EMS divides to give an
            anterior daughter (MS) with higher nuclear POP-1 levels (dark circle) that generates
            mesodermal tissues, and a posterior daughter (E) with lower nuclear POP-1 levels (light
            circle) that generates only endoderm. In mutants giving a Mom phenotype, two MS-like
            daughters are born, with higher nuclear POP-1 levels. In a <emphasis>pop-1</emphasis>
            mutant, two E-like daughters are born.</para>
