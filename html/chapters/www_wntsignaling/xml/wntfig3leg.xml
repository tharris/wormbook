        <title>Figure 3. Canonical Wnt pathway in Q progeny</title>
        <para>Proteins functioning in the canonical Wnt pathway active in the QL progeny are shown.
            Homologous vertebrate protein names are shown in parenthesis. The two horizontal lines
            indicate the plasma membranes of the signaling cell (top line) and QL.d (bottom line).
            The MIG-14/MOM-3 locus has not been identified yet, but acts in the signaling cell in
            P2-EMS signaling, so is shown in that position here. Active kinases are shown in red.
            The exact position of some components in the pathway, when not clear from epistasis
            experiments, is based on analogy to canonical pathways in other species.</para>
