		<para>AcetylCoA is the building block of fatty acids that are assembled into storage triglycerides through step-wise enzymatic processes. Inhibiting delta-9 desaturase activity (<emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=SCD-1;class=Protein" role="_blank">SCD-1</ulink></emphasis> in mammals, <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=fat-5;class=Gene" role="_blank">fat-5</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=fat-6;class=Gene" role="_blank">fat-6</ulink>, and <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=fat-7;class=Gene" role="_blank">fat-7</ulink></emphasis> in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>) causes accumulation of saturated fatty acids. Consequently, acetylCoA carboxylase (ACC) is inactivated through feedback inhibition. This results in reduced levels of the ACC product malonyl-CoA. Since malonyl-CoA is an inhibitor of carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase (CPT), ACC inhibition results in activation of CPT, allowing uptake of fatty acids into mitochondria where they are broken down via <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x003B2;</symbol>-oxidation.
