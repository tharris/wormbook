		<title>Figure 6. Systemic actions of insulin signaling in mammals</title>
		<para>In response to nutrients (e.g., glucose) insulin signaling promotes uptake and storage of glucose as glycogen and triglycerides in muscle and adipocytes, respectively. Concomitantly, insulin inhibits triglyceride and glycogen breakdown pathways in these tissues. Similarly, insulin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycongenolysis while promoting glycogen synthesis. In both liver and muscle, insulin also promotes glucose breakdown. Insulin signaling in brain inhibits feeding behavior and activates energy expenditure pathways. Tissue-specific insulin receptor knockouts have revealed complex compensatory mechanisms. Pathways activated by insulin signaling are shown in green. Pathways inhibited are shown in light gray. Additional actions of insulin on protein synthesis/breakdown and other tissues are not shown.</para>
