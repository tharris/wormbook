<title>Figure 17. Diagram of crosses testing for the monofactorial segregation of recessive mutations, and allelism and genetic linkage of two dwarf mutations.</title><para>&ldquo;From <link linkend="bib76">Dion and Brun (1971)</link><!--PMID: 5115378-->, with permission from Springer Publishing Company&rdquo;. Rectangles: crosses leading to the next generation. White circle: self-fertilization. N: normal phenotype. n: dwarf phenotype ('nain&rsquo; in French). The proportion of 3 normal animals to 1 dwarf in the F2 generation (bottom center) indicated that the mutation was recessive and monofactorial. &lsquo;N.a&rsquo; indicates a cross of a normal male with a n<subscript>a</subscript> hermaphrodite, &lsquo;Na.b&rsquo; of the hybrid F1 male to a n<subscript>b</subscript> hermaphrodite, etc. The latter cross showed that the dwarf mutations a and b were not allelic. On the lower right, the proportion of 9 normal to 7 dwarfs corresponded to the case of two unlinked mutations; a proportion of 3 N to 1 n corresponded to closely linked mutations. Black and white dots, as well as full and dotted arrows, corresponded to mutations a and b, respectively.</para>
