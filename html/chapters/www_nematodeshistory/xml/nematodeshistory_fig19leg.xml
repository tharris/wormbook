<title>Figure 19. Progressive decline in brood size at high temperature of down-shifted cultures as a function of the number of generations spent at 18&deg;C.</title><para>Top: design of the experiment, with temperature in the vertical axis, generations in the horizontal axis. The high-temperature adapted strain was down-shifted to 18&deg;C for a varying number of generations and up-shifted again at 23.5&deg;C. A control was maintained at 18&deg;C. Bottom: brood size after return to high temperature, as a function of the number of generations at 18&deg;C (horizontal axis). Filled symbols: mean brood size in % of the 18&deg;C control (left scale). Empty symbols: mean brood size in absolute value (right scale). Circles: highly adapted line &lsquo;453', squares; less adapted line &lsquo;277'.
