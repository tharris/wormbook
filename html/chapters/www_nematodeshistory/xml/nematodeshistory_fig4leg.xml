<title>Figure 4. Oogenesis in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans.</emphasis></title><para>Rearranged from Nigon and Brun (1955), with permission from Springer Publishing Company. Left: Drawing of an ovary arm in the adult hermaphrodite, showing the successive stages of oogenesis. (A-B) Mitotic zone. (B-C) Synapsis zone. (C-D) Pachytene zone. (D-G) From pachytene to diakinesis. (E) Dispersed (diffuse) stage. (F) Formation of V-like figures. (G) Diakinesis. S: Sperm in spermatheca. Right: Feulgen staining of chromosomes at successive stages, from left to right and top to bottom, some being labeled with a letter corresponding to the gonad zone in the left drawing. The last panel shows 18 putative successive stages for one chromosome, from pachytene to terminal diakinesis. 6-9: V shapes. 13-15: Cruciform tetrads; a shorter arm gives a Phi shape. 18-19: Bivalents.</para>
