<title>Figure 3. The sexual chromosome in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>: cytological analysis.</title><para>Assembled from Nigon (1949). Feulgen staining of chromosomes. (A) The chromosomal content was observed in prophase of meiosis I to be of six bivalents in hermaphrodites, and of five bivalents and one univalent (the X chromosome) in males. The chromosomal content was more difficult to see on pictures of spermatogenesis. (B) Delay of the X chromosome (small dot) in the first division of hermaphrodite spermatogenesis. This delay was seen more clearly in <emphasis role="italic">O. dolichura</emphasis> (not shown here). (C) Two possible behaviors of the X chromosome in male meiosis, with reduction at the first or second division. Note also the delay in X chromosome separation in anaphase. The pictures below were taken in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans.</emphasis> In <emphasis role="italic">O. dolichura</emphasis>, the top case where the first meiotic division is equational for the X chromosome (reductional for the autosomes) was most frequent.</para>
