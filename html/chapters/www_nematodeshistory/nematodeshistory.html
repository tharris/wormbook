            <p><span class="bold"><strong>The nematode <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> is now a major model organism in biology. The choice of Sydney Brenner to adopt this species in the mid-1960s and the success
                     of his team in raising it to a model organism status have been told (<a href="http://www.wormbook.org/toc_wormhistory.html" target="_top">http://www.wormbook.org/toc_wormhistory.html</a>; <a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>; <a href="#bib13">Ankeny, 2001</a>). Here we review the pre-Brenner history of the use of free-living nematodes as models for general questions in biology.
                     We focus on the period that started in 1899 with the first publication of Emile Maupas mentioning <span class="italic">Rhabditis elegans</span> and ended in 1974 with the first publications by Brenner. A common thread in this period, aided by the variety in modes of
                     reproduction of different nematode species, is found in studies of meiosis, fertilization, heredity, and sex determination.
                     Maupas in his 1900 opus on reproduction had already chosen <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> as the species of reference. Hikokura Honda determined its hermaphrodite chromosomal content in 1925. <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> was again isolated and chosen as a main subject by Victor Nigon in the 1940-50s. Nigon mastered crosses between <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> hermaphrodites and males, described the meiotic behavior of chromosomes in XX hermaphrodites and X0 males and, using tetraploids,
                     correctly inferred that sex was determined by X chromosome to autosome dosage. With Ellsworth Dougherty, Nigon isolated and
                     studied a <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> body size mutant and a <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000031;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">slow growth</a> mutant. Dougherty and his team devoted most of their work to finding a defined culture medium to screen for physiological
                     mutants, focusing on <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span>. With Helene Fatt, Dougherty also performed the first genetic study of natural variation in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, concerning the difference in heat resistance of the Bergerac and Bristol strains. Jean Brun, a student of Nigon, performed
                     a long and remarkable experiment in acclimatization of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> Bergerac to higher temperatures, the significance of which remains to be clarified.</strong></span></p>

            <p>The small nematode roundworm <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> has become one of the main model organisms, allowing for major discoveries in molecular and cell biology, on par with the
               vinegar fly (<span class="italic">Drosophila</span> melanogaster) and baker's yeast (<span class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>). Historical studies of the development of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> as a model organism usually start with the major figure of Sydney Brenner in the 1960s and neglect the earlier period. We
               were led to write about this early history for a number of reasons. First, this account helps bring to light historical developments
               in the study of free-living nematodes as model organisms, with their difficulties, stimulations, achievements, and cross-influences.
               Second, this work will also hopefully revive scientific questions that were forgotten or neglected over the last 50 years,
               which, in the light of today's knowledge, may lead to new research avenues. Finally, many of the early studies were published
               in French or German and are therefore not easily read by modern readers. Note that the first author of this chapter worked
               on <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> and other free-living nematodes in the 1940-50s, and particular emphasis is thus given to his personal account and biography
               (see <a href="#sec18" title="18.&nbsp;Appendix 3. Biographies">Appendix 3</a>, <a href="#sec18.4" title="18.4.&nbsp;Victor Marc Nigon (11 October 1920 - 5 July 2015)">Section 18.4</a>).
            </p>
            <p>This article will focus on free-living nematodes, with particular attention to <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>. Yet, of note, parasitic nematodes such as <span class="italic">Ascaris</span> have played a key role in the history of biology. Indeed, in the period spanning 1880-1910, <span class="italic">Ascaris</span> was arguably the first model organism. The species <span class="italic">A. megalocephala</span> (now called <span class="italic">Parascaris equorum</span>) was then commonly found in horses, <span class="italic">A. suum</span> and <span class="italic">A. lumbricoides</span> in pigs and humans. As stated by Edouard van Beneden, &#8220;I have found with the <span class="italic">Ascaris</span> of the horse, a wonderful material. I am convinced that the egg of this nematode will soon become a classical object of study
               to investigate and illustrate the phenomena connected with fecundation.&#8221; (<a href="#bib313">Van Beneden, 1883</a>; <a href="#bib121">Hamoir, 1992</a>). Gametogenesis and fertilization could be observed readily on fixed and stained material because of the transparency of
               reproductive organs, the large sperm size, and the small number of chromosomes (one pair in the <span class="italic">univalens</span> variety of the horse parasite, two in the <span class="italic">bivalen</span>s variety). Cells, chromosomes, and centrosomes could be followed during meiosis, fertilization, and early development. <span class="italic">Ascaris</span> species thereby greatly contributed to the discovery of basic biological mechanisms, such as fertilization and meiosis (<a href="#bib313">Van Beneden, 1883</a>; <a href="#bib34">Boveri, 1887</a>; reviewed in <a href="#bib121">Hamoir, 1992</a>; <a href="#bib181">Maderspacher, 2008</a>), and later to studies in development, including the role of nucleus-cytoplasm interactions, embryonic axis formation, germ
               cell lineage (<a href="#bib35">Boveri, 1892</a>; <a href="#bib36">Boveri, 1899</a>: <a href="#bib37">Boveri, 1910</a>; <a href="#bib335">zur Strassen, 1896</a>; <a href="#bib336">zur Strassen, 1959</a>; <a href="#bib283">Spemann, 1895</a>; <a href="#bib203">Muller, 1903</a>; <a href="#bib31">Bonfig, 1925</a>), and the nervous system (<a href="#bib110">Goldschmidt, 1908</a>; <a href="#bib111">Goldschmidt, 1909</a>). Two features of <span class="italic">Ascaris</span> turned out to be somewhat idiosyncratic. In particular, chromatin diminution (<a href="#bib202">M&uuml;ller, 1996</a>) only occurs in some nematodes such as <span class="italic">Ascaris</span>, but not in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>. The elimination of chromosome fragments in somatic cells thus did not turn out to be a general mechanism for divergence
               of cell fates during development. The second feature, invariance of cell number (<a href="#bib184">Martini, 1923</a>), is more commonly found in nematodes and other organisms. The reproducibility of nematode cell lineages turned out to be
               of utmost practical importance in post-1974 studies of apoptosis, development, and neurobiology in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>.
            </p>
            <p>The success of parasitic nematode species as biological models thus set the stage for free-living nematodes, &#8220;the small nematodes&#8221;
               as they were called, to be adopted by a few biologists, who albeit were often not in the mainstream of research. Free-living
               species, in contrast to obligate parasites, can be cultured in the absence of a host through their whole lifecycle, which
               is one of the characteristics that has allowed <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> to become a major model species for genetic analysis.
            </p>
            <p>The first important phase in the history of the study of free-living nematodes was devoted to their collection and morphological
               observation. For these millimeter-sized animals, this phase started with the advent of microscopy in the 17th century. The
               inventor of the microscope, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, himself reported in 1676 observations in old wine of &#8220;small living Creatures,
               shaped like little Eels&#8221; (van Leeuwenhoeck, 1676)&#8211;perhaps the &#8220;vinegar eel&#8221; <span class="italic">Turbatrix aceti</span>. In this first phase, authors generally aimed to describe and classify species, while also providing some information on
               their habitats. Most studies included a comparison of many different species, such as the 1866 monograph by <a href="#bib269">Schneider (1866)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>A second historical phase began at the end of the 19th century, when nematodes started to be used as model species to study
               general biological mechanisms. Observations were often supplemented by basic experimentation. As one of the main properties
               of free-living species was their ability to be cultured continuously, many authors first dealt with culture methods and observations
               of the lifecycle. A few conducted experiments, which could span one or several generations. This phase was often the work
               of solitary researchers, some of amazing quality. A key figure of this phase is Emile Maupas, a professional archivist and
               librarian living in Algiers and working on biology as a personal interest (see <a href="#sec18" title="18.&nbsp;Appendix 3. Biographies">Appendix 3</a>, <a href="#sec18.1" title="18.1.&nbsp;Emile Maupas (1842-1916)">Section 18.1</a>). He was the first to isolate and name <span class="italic">Rhabditis elegans</span> (now <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</span>) (<a href="#bib186">Maupas, 1900</a>). He described nematode species, not for the sake of systematics, but for their use in more general biological studies. Specifically,
               his two important articles on free-living nematodes concerned: 1) the molts and the alternative development via the dauer
               larvae (&#8220;enkysted larvae&#8221;) (<a href="#bib185">Maupas, 1899</a>), and 2) the modes of reproduction and their variations (<a href="#bib186">Maupas, 1900</a>). Maupas had already used <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> in the 1899 publication, and more formally described the species in his 1900 article. In the latter study, which particularly
               focused on hermaphroditism, Maupas studied about 20 species. However, <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> was already the first and most developed example and his primary reference species. Compared to previous authors, Maupas
               can be distinguished by his use of a more experimental approach, albeit rudimentary. He was the first to perform crosses to
               try to analyze mechanisms of sex determination. After him, Eva Kr&uuml;ger, Paula Hertwig, Karl B&#283;la&#345;, and Hikokura Honda each
               independently studied the reproduction and cytology of different rhabditid species (<a href="#bib163">Kr&uuml;ger, 1913</a>; <a href="#bib128">Hertwig, 1920</a>; <a href="#bib24">B&#283;la&#345;, 1923</a>; <a href="#bib25">B&#283;la&#345;, 1924</a>; <a href="#bib142">Honda, 1925</a>). In particular, Honda isolated <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> again and determined that hermaphrodites have six pairs of chromosomes. At this time, individual biologists worked on a wide
               variety of organisms. For several, such as Otto B&uuml;tschli, Maupas, and B&#283;la&#345;, this additional focus included protists, especially
               ciliates.
            </p>
            <p>A third historical phase in free-living nematode research started in the 1940s, with the birth of the first teams who used
               free-living nematodes as model organisms, headed by Victor M. Nigon and Ellsworth C. Dougherty (see <a href="#sec18" title="18.&nbsp;Appendix 3. Biographies">Appendix 3</a>, <a href="#sec18.4" title="18.4.&nbsp;Victor Marc Nigon (11 October 1920 - 5 July 2015)">Section 18.4</a> and <a href="#sec18.5" title="18.5.&nbsp;Ellsworth C. Dougherty (1921-1965)">Section 18.5</a>). Nigon was led to nematodes by the vagaries of circumstances. As a young student during the war, he needed to work at home,
               far from the university, and his Professor, Albert Vandel, suggested that he work on free-living nematodes. Vandel was aware
               of the potential utility of these species through the work of Maupas and B&#283;la&#345;. Dougherty, who had so far mostly studied parasitic
               nematodes, joined Nigon in Paris then Lyon to perform experimental work. He focused on <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> after having obtained a culture of this species from Margaret Briggs. The two teams of Nigon (in Lyon) and Dougherty (in
               California) remained in close contact during this period. Devoted to the analysis of reproduction and nutrition, respectively,
               they solved several basic problems. First and foremost, culture conditions and experimental methods were refined, increasing
               the reproducibility of experiments. Also, the laboratories began to devote more effort to focus on a smaller number of model
               species. Following the example set by Thomas Hunt Morgan in <span class="italic">Drosophila</span>, Nigon succeeded in setting up strictly controlled culture conditions using regular transfers of single animals that served
               as the basis for more rigorous studies. Most importantly, crosses of selfing species such as <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> were mastered (<a href="#bib210">Nigon, 1943</a>) and the chromosomal basis of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> sex determination was determined using cytological studies of meiosis and making use of a tetraploid line (<a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>; <a href="#bib215">Nigon 1951a</a>). The team leaders were conscious of the exceptional potential of free-living nematodes. Despite this obvious promise, their
               projects did not then succeed in convincing funding authorities and assembling specialists in complementary fields. This meant
               that by 1952 Nigon started to develop other scientific projects, apparently more in step with the development of molecular
               biology, while his student Jean-Louis Brun continued on <span class="italic">C. elegans,</span> on a difficult project of laboratory adaptation. Dougherty's problems in getting financial support continued, which led him
               to criticize funding practices in the United States (see <a href="#bib81">Dougherty, 1959</a>, p. 45).
            </p>
            <p>The fourth phase in the development of free-living nematodes as model organisms started for <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> in 1974, with the first publications by Sydney Brenner and his collaborators. This phase is perhaps the best known. Sydney
               Brenner, one of the founders of molecular biology in the 1950-60s and a very experienced and well-known bacterial geneticist,
               decided to start a new research program in developmental biology and neurobiology (<a href="#bib42">Brenner, 1988</a>). Conscious of the limits of bacteria and of the need to bring the genetics of animals towards molecular biology, he was
               tempted by free-living nematodes, and was particularly inspired by Richard Goldschmidt's work (<a href="#bib110">Goldschmidt, 1908</a>; <a href="#bib111">Goldschmidt, 1909</a>) on neuronal cell invariance and nervous system connectivity in <span class="italic">Ascaris</span>, as well as perhaps being influenced by Dougherty whom he met in Berkeley (<a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>). Brenner experimented with many nematode species, and isolated a number of new strains, before finally settling on <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> around 1966 (<a href="#bib40">Brenner, 1966/1981</a>). The fame enjoyed by Brenner and the place where he worked (the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology
               in Cambridge, UK) allowed him to succeed in obtaining the funding that his predecessors had sought in vain and he could recruit
               an outstanding set of colleagues to work on this new project. Brenner's knowledge of bacterial genetics and molecular biology
               enabled him to overcome some of the obstacles that had been challenging to Nigon and Dougherty. He thus opened up a field
               full of new perspectives and innovation.
            </p>
            <p>The study of free-living nematodes has been built upon work conducted during each of these four phases of research. The present
               article will focus primarily on work with free-living nematodes during the second and third phases of their development as
               model organisms. We chose to emphasize experiments using <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> (and <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span>), with particular attention on studies of variation in modes of reproduction. Keeping track of work using a variety of free-living
               nematode species also helps to provide context for the progressive focus of scientists on <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>. A more extensive review covering the work of additional authors, especially in developmental biology, can be found in <a href="#bib219">Nigon (1965)</a>, in French. The individual sections below, rather than following a historical thread across these two phases, are divided
               along different biological questions. Work conducted during the fourth phase has solved some of the outstanding questions
               from the earlier era and will be referred to as a complement at the end of each section or subsection (&#8220;In today's light&#8221;).
               We will end with an epilogue, which will reflect back on some of the early developments that remain unexplored today (2015)
               and may still open new horizons.
            </p>
            <p>Regarding taxonomy, note that nematode genus and species names have varied during this historical period. For the ease of
               reading, we generally use the current taxonomy. A table containing old and present names is found in <a href="#sec16" title="16.&nbsp;Appendix 1. Table 3. Main species mentioned in the text with their modern names and mode of reproduction.">Appendix 1</a> (<a href="#sec16" title="16.&nbsp;Appendix 1. Table 3. Main species mentioned in the text with their modern names and mode of reproduction.">Section 16</a>). For example, <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> was called <span class="italic">Rhabditis elegans</span>, when it was formally described by Maupas (<a href="#bib185">Maupas, 1899</a>; <a href="#bib186">Maupas, 1900</a>). The <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> genus was then subdivided into subgenera by <a href="#bib231">G&uuml;nther Osche (1952)</a>, and these subgenera raised to the status of genera by <a href="#bib80">Dougherty (1953)</a>. Many species that belonged to the <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> genus before 1950 are thus now in different genera, called <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis</span>, <span class="italic">Oscheius</span>, <span class="italic">Pellioditis</span>, <span class="italic">Mesorhabditis</span>, etc. Similarly, the genus <span class="italic">Pristionchus</span> was previously part of <span class="italic">Diplogaster</span> (<a href="#bib297">Sudhaus and F&uuml;rst von Lieven, 2003</a>). See <a href="#bib158">Kiontke et al. (2007)</a> for a current phylogeny of the rhabditids, and <a href="#bib296">Sudhaus (2011)</a> for the latest systematic denominations. Phylogenetic analysis shows how parasitic and free-living nematodes are evolutionarily
               intermingled (<a href="#bib30">Blaxter et al., 1998</a>). Only a few strains isolated and studied before the 1970s&#8211;such as <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> Bergerac&#8211;were maintained in culture past this date and later frozen down. Current collections however contain new isolates
               of most previously studied species.

               <p>Until 1920, most authors employed culture methods based on those of <a href="#bib186">Maupas (1900)</a>. The container was a hollow slide, a watch glass or a Petri dish, maintained in a humid chamber or under glass sealed with
                  paraffin oil. The medium was a layer of water, <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000164;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">thin</a> enough to allow for oxygenation. Food was provided by pieces of decomposing meat, the nematodes feeding on the bacteria that
                  grew on them. Some authors tried peptone solutions with variable success. Haven Metcalf was the first to employ agar media
                  (<a href="#bib194">Metcalf, 1903</a>).
               </p>
               <p>When comparing the culture methods used for free-living nematodes with those in practice in <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> genetics, Nigon noticed major differences (<a href="#bib210">Nigon, 1943</a>). In <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> crosses, progenitors were isolated by pairs and transferred every day to new containers. They thus received constant and
                  reproducible conditions. For nematodes, transfer of isolated progenitors could be achieved more readily by replacing the liquid
                  medium with an agar medium. Nigon thus poured an agar medium in large drops on preparation slides that were maintained in
                  humid chambers (<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>). The medium was seeded with micro-organisms that served as food: first yeasts, easily obtainable anywhere, which were later
                  replaced by defined bacterial cultures by Dougherty and Brun. The animals developed in a confined medium because those venturing
                  outside the drop onto the glass surface were threatened by rapid desiccation. Every day the adult(s) were moved to a new drop,
                  leaving the progeny produced during 24 hours on the previous drop. In some difficult research settings (Bergerac), the animals
                  were followed with the naked eye, transported with a wood needle, with a possible <span class="italic">a posteriori</span> confirmation of their number and sex using a low-magnification compound microscope (<a href="#bib210">Nigon, 1943</a>) (<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>). In more comfortable laboratory conditions, all manipulations were carried out under the dissecting microscope (<a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>).

               <p>Following procedures established for <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> by Margaret Briggs in her 1946 Master thesis at Stanford University, <a href="#bib84">Dougherty and Calhoun (1948b)</a> also used an agar medium, seeded with a culture of <span class="italic">E. coli</span>. By treating isolated animals with antiseptic solutions, they achieved monoxenic cultures.
               </p>
               <p>Dougherty and his collaborators devoted the greatest part of their activity to seeking a chemically defined culture medium.
                  Their plan was to look for nutritional mutants, following the work of George Beadle and Edward Tatum with <span class="italic">Neurospora</span> (<a href="#bib84">Dougherty and Calhoun, 1948b</a>). A first step towards this goal was to succeed in employing an axenic liquid medium containing either a chick embryo or
                  a liver extract (<a href="#bib79">Dougherty, 1950</a>; <a href="#bib81">Dougherty et al., 1959</a>), but the composition of these media still remained largely undetermined.
               </p>
               <p>The next objective was thus to create a fully chemically defined medium. In their last publications on the subject (<a href="#bib81">Dougherty et al., 1959</a>; <a href="#bib209">Nicholas et al., 1959</a>), the authors described a fully defined medium (GS-25), which could sustain the development of larvae into adults, with,
                  only once, the production of an F1 generation. The addition to this medium of 1% of a protein fraction of liver (LPF-C) allowed
                  them to obtain up to eight successive generations. They concluded with the following sentence: &#8220;The axenic cultivation of
                  <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> on a chemically defined medium still presents challenges. Undoubtedly, more workers are needed.&#8221; (<a href="#bib81">Dougherty et al., 1959</a>).

               <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
               <p>Nigon succeeded in setting up strictly controlled culture conditions, using an agar medium and regular transfers of single
                  animals, where the free-living nematodes could grow and mate (<a href="#bib210">Nigon, 1943</a>). Culture conditions and nematode transfer methods have not greatly changed since, but have tended to converge to one standard
                  agar medium (called Nematode Growth Medium or NGM agar, Maintenance of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>), now poured into plastic Petri dishes. Following <a href="#bib41">Brenner (1974)</a>, <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> is fed monoxenically a growth-restricted <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> strain called <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=OP50;class=Strain" target="_blank">OP50</a>, which allows for better observation of the animals on the <span class="italic">E. coli</span> lawn (<a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_strainmaintain/strainmaintain.html" target="_blank">Maintenance of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span></a>). Strains can now be kept frozen, a major improvement in terms of strain maintenance and genotype stability.
               </p>
               <p>The serious efforts called for by <a href="#bib81">Dougherty et al. (1959)</a> have been made: the nutritional requirements of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> and <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> are now understood and a chemically defined axenic culture medium has been devised. An excellent analysis of subsequent studies
                  performed by Dougherty's and other teams is available in <a href="#bib208">Nicholas (1975)</a>, including those by W.F. Hieb who had worked in Dougherty's laboratory (<a href="#bib130">Hieb and Dougherty, 1966</a>). Specifically, <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> was found to require some external sterol source (<a href="#bib131">Hieb and Rothstein, 1968</a>; now added as cholesterol in the agar medium, because <span class="italic">E. coli</span> does not provide it), as well as heme (<a href="#bib132">Hieb et al., 1970</a>; <a href="#bib252">Rao et al., 2005</a>). In modern standard culture conditions, the heme is provided by <span class="italic">E. coli</span>, but in axenic conditions, heme must be provided, together with a carrier protein (<a href="#bib55">Buecher et al., 1970</a>; <a href="#bib315">Vanfleteren, 1974</a>). A chemically defined medium could finally be devised, where the worms could proliferate, albeit more slowly (<a href="#bib177">Lu and Goetsch, 1993</a>; <a href="#bib304">Szewczyk et al., 2003</a>). This medium is rarely used, although it is famous for space shipping and <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> survival after the Columbia space shuttle disaster (Szewczyk et al., 2005). Nutritional requirements of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> have been studied by Nancy Lu and her team in Berkeley and San Jose, California (<a href="#bib178">Lu et al., 1977</a>; <a href="#bib176">Lu et al., 1983</a>; <a href="#bib177">Lu and Goetsch, 1993</a>; <a href="#bib244">Perelman and Lu, 2000</a>; <a href="#bib17">Balachandar and Lu, 2005</a>; <a href="#bib333">Zhao and Lu, 2008</a>; <a href="#bib330">Xiong and Lu, 2011</a>). The genetic screens for nutritional mutants that Dougherty dreamt of are still to come, but other physiological studies
                  are promising.

               <p>Earlier authors, such as Maupas, were able to observe live animals in the microscope. To visualize chromosomes, Eva Kr&uuml;ger
                  was the first in 1913 (after Boveri on <span class="italic">Ascaris</span>) to embed animals in paraffin, section and stain them with hematoxylin. This technique did not allow an easy analysis of
                  the succession of cellular structures during gametogenesis of a given individual. Nigon (<a href="#bib211">Nigon, 1946</a>; <a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>) then established a method that overcame this difficulty. A microknife was built by breaking the edge of a razor blade with
                  forceps. This small blade was inserted into the chuck of a watchmaker tool. An individual, male or female, was transported
                  onto a dry preparation slide into a small waterdrop. A strike of the microknife skillfully aimed at the nematode's flanks
                  made it expel its internal organs. A drop of Carnoy fixative was immediately added, ensuring at the same time the fixation
                  of the animal and the coagulation of the expelled substances. After this surgery, the dissected animal was stuck on the glass
                  surface, with its internal organs spread out. The preparation was subjected to the Feulgen reaction, which colored DNA bright
                  red. After a brief drying step, a drop of mounting medium and a coverslip were added, with no need for sectioning. Except
                  for the Feulgen reaction, which dates from the 1930s, this method was derived from a technique that had been in common use
                  in protistology for a long time. It is thus somewhat surprising that protistologists such as Maupas and B&#283;la&#345; did not apply
                  it to nematodes. Using this method, one can follow the successive steps of gametogenesis as they occur along the genital tract
                  of a single individual (<a href="#bib221">Nigon and Brun, 1955</a>) (see <a href="#sec4.3" title="4.3.&nbsp;Meiosis in a sexual species, C. elegans">Section 4.3</a>). A few such preparations were sufficient to capture all steps of gametogenesis and fertilization. Phase contrast microscopy
                  further helped visualization. As was already achieved by previous authors, one could follow and film the developmental process
                  in different focal planes, on isolated eggs or on the live animal without prior dissection (<a href="#bib226">Nigon et al., 1960</a>).
               </p>
               <p>Later, the same razor blade technique was applied to animals after incubation with radioactive (tritiated) thymidine for a
                  few hours. The animals were dissected and covered with a sensitive film in the dark room. DNA synthesis could thus be followed
                  during gametogenesis (Nonnenmacher-Godet and Dougherty, 1964).
               </p>
               <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
               <p>The razor blade technique described by Nigon is still being used for gonadal and intestinal staining, as well as for egg and
                  early embryo isolation. Advances in microscopy have been crucial. Nomarski microscopy allowed the nucleus of each cell to
                  be followed in a live animal and rendered possible the determination of the entire cell lineage by John Sulston et al., from
                  egg to adult (<a href="#bib300">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</a>; <a href="#bib302">Sulston et al., 1983</a>). 4D-microscopy movies (with different focal planes over time as in <a href="#bib226">Nigon et al., 1960</a>) are now achieved through automatic recording, which further facilitates the determination of cell lineages. The development
                  of electron microscopy was also crucial, especially to determine the wiring of neurons (<a href="#bib324">White et al., 1986</a>). Fluorescent Hoechst staining or labeling of histones with Green Fluorescent Protein are now used to observe DNA in live
                  animals. Specific staining of a given sequence of nucleic acids or of a protein is now possible by <span class="italic">in situ</span> hybridization (Single molecule fluorescent <span class="italic">in situ</span> hybridization (smFISH) of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> worms and embryos), immunostaining (Immunohistochemistry), and/or transgenic fusions of endogenous proteins with fluorescent
                  proteins (Reporter gene fusions).

            <p>Since the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, nematodes have been model organisms, not only to study meiosis and fertilization, but also <span class="italic">variation</span> in reproductive modes. Maupas&#8217; 1900 major opus (over 160 pages, in French), entitled &#8220;Modes and forms of reproduction of
               nematodes", focused on several types of variation relative to the standard male-female reproduction. The main emphasis was
               on hermaphroditic reproduction, and particularly that of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>. Interest in the diversity of nematode reproductive modes and the underlying cellular and chromosomal processes run through
               the first half of the 20th century&#8211;successively through Eva Kr&uuml;ger, Paula Hertwig, Karl B&#283;la&#345;, Frank Armitage Potts, and Hikokura
               Honda to Victor M. Nigon. A second landmark article was Nigon's 1949 publication, entitled (in French) &#8220;Modes of reproduction
               and sex determination in some free-living nematodes&#8221; (<a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>). This 135-page article demonstrated the XX/X0 chromosomal basis of sex determination in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, and observed X-chromosome non-disjunction during meiosis in <span class="italic">Oscheius dolichura</span> hermaphrodites. Less known today are his analyses of meiosis and fertilization in other free-living nematodes, including
               pseudogamy in <span class="italic">Mesorhabditis belari</span>. We review hermaphroditism in this section, chromosomal sex detemination in <a href="#sec4" title="4.&nbsp;Sex determination and meiosis in sexual species">Section 4</a>, and parthenogenesis (including pseudogamy) in <a href="#sec5" title="5.&nbsp;Parthenogenesis">Section 5</a>.

               <p>Many free-living nematodes have separate sexes (gonochorism). The gonad of females produces oocytes, that of males spermatozoa.
                  After mating, spermatozoa are stored in the spermatheca of the female gonad, usually located between the site of oocyte maturation
                  and the uterus. When oocytes mature, they pass one after the other through the spermatheca where they are fertilized.
               </p>
               <p>A key observation of <a href="#bib186">Maupas (1900)</a> was that in nematodes, the hermaphrodite individuals display a female body morphology. In their germ line, gametogenesis
                  begins in early adulthood with the production of sperm, which is then stored in the spermatheca (<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>). Oogenesis then occurs in a chain of successive maturations along the gonadal axis, as in true females. This mode of reproduction
                  is thus called protandric hermaphroditism. As in true females, the most mature oocyte passes through the spermatheca and becomes
                  fertilized by self-sperm. In sum, the hermaphrodites are similar to the females as far as the soma is concerned and only differ
                  in germ line behavior. One must thus distinguish in these species between sexual differentiation of the soma and that of the
                  germ line (<a href="#bib186">Maupas, 1900</a>; <a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>).

               <p>In most hermaphroditic species, male individuals are also produced at a frequency of around 0.1-1%. These males produce sperm
                  of identical shape as those produced by hermaphrodites. According to Maupas, however, these males (here of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>) appear to have little sexual instinct: &#8220;I actually doubt that any male ever occurs in nature. With animals so little lustful
                  as the males of our Rhabditis, the very special conditions of sequestration in which I maintained them must be required to
                  induce some of them to mate.&#8221;. They often show variability at the level of the male tail and spicules. Some intersex males
                  that form oocytes in their testis have been observed (<a href="#bib186">Maupas, 1900</a>; <a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>) (<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>E).
               </p>
               <p>Maupas tested the ability of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> to reproduce for many generations through self-fertilization without outcrossing. He cited Charles Darwin on the fact that
                  outcrossing seemed favored in nature: &#8220;Nature thus tells us, in the most emphatic manner, that she abhors perpetual self-fertilisation&#8221;
                  and &#8220;No hermaphrodite fertilises itself for a perpetuity of generations&#8221;. Testing Darwin's suppositions, Maupas transferred
                  20 virgin <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> hermaphrodites per generation, during 50 generations. He observed no degeneration. (His experiment was interrupted by summer,
                  the high temperature likely causing sterility of the line.) He concluded that outcrossing is not necessary, at least in the
                  short term.

               <p>Maupas&#8217; article compared reproduction of several hermaphroditic nematode species (<a href="#bib186">Maupas, 1900</a>). Different species displayed at the level of the sexual structures and of the mode of reproduction a considerable variability
                  of modalities, sometimes within the same species:
               </p>
               <p>1) Maupas found <span class="italic">Reiterina viguieri</span> to be the closest to the reproduction of gonochoristic species, with about 5% males. These males were active and often found
                  mating. Among females (the term included all somatically female individuals, including hermaphrodites), about one in ten was
                  without sperm. This species thus included three sexual forms: hermaphrodite (most common), female and male. Maupas did not
                  systematically study the progeny of different types of females, crossed or not with males.
               </p>
               <p>2) In <span class="italic">Rhabditis marionis</span>, Maupas observed a lower frequency of males, 0.76%. Many hermaphrodites of this species laid fertilized and unfertilized
                  eggs at the same time. Maupas hypothesized that the presence of unfertilized eggs (also observed in <span class="italic">Rhabditis duthiersi</span>) may be due to the fact that spermatogenesis only occurred in one of the two ovaries. This remains unclear as Maupas did
                  not directly assess the absence of sperm with his microscope and this has not been studied since.
               </p>
               <p>3) In <span class="italic">Rhabditis guignardi</span>, Maupas observed the smallest proportion of males (0.015%). Hermaphrodites produced many sperm and on average 520 progeny
                  per individual&#8211;thus, much more than other hermaphroditic species (usually 300 or less).
               </p>
               <p>After Maupas, F. A. Potts (<a href="#bib249">Potts, 1910</a>), based in England, studied new hermaphroditic species, which he described succinctly (<span class="italic">Pristionchus linstowi</span>, <span class="italic">Pristionchus maupasi,</span> and <span class="italic">Rhabditis gurneyi</span>). By culturing <span class="italic">P. maupasi</span> unmated hermaphrodites on different peptone solutions in different instances and locations, Potts noticed in their progeny
                  large variations in male frequencies, ranging between a very low value and 30%. He did not control several factors, such as
                  temperature, which may have caused variations in observed male frequencies. Potts reported that <span class="italic">R. gurneyi</span> females first produced unfertilized oocytes, then fertilized ones. He interpreted these results to mean that some individuals
                  displayed several successive phases of spermatogenesis. Like Maupas&#8217; hypothesis above, Potts&#8217; hypothesis on <span class="italic">R. gurneyi</span> was never verified by a direct observation of spermatogenesis, and the laying of unfertilized eggs may be explained by factors
                  other than the lack of sperm. His results, thus, remain unclear and have not been reproduced.

               <p>At the time of Maupas&#8217; work, a chromosomal basis for sex determination was not known. <a href="#bib186">Maupas (1900)</a> attempted matings between the hermaphrodites and the rare males that they produced via self-fertilization. To avoid interference
                  by hermaphrodite sperm, Maupas used old females, presumed to have exhausted their own sperm, as inferred by the fact that
                  they had ceased to lay developing embryos for at least 24 hours. Maupas mostly used <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> for his experiments. He set up eight cultures by mixing several hermaphrodites and several males. Two did not yield any progeny,
                  while the six others produced 127 males and 147 hermaphrodites, thus approximately an equal number. Some resulting males were
                  intersex, with oocytes in the testis (as shown in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>E). When isolated, the F1 hermaphrodites gave rise mostly to hermaphrodites, with only 0.23% males. The F1 males were associated
                  with other old hermaphrodites in five cultures (each with 4-11 males). In this second generation, no progeny were obtained.
                  Seven other hermaphroditic species tested by Maupas in the same manner were infertile in the first generation of mating pairs.
                  In <span class="italic">R. marionis</span> and <span class="italic">R. duthiersi</span>, the old hermaphrodites placed with males yielded only further hermaphrodites. In summary, Maupas succeeded in mating <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> for one generation, which indicated that outcrossing with males may increase male production. But his results could not be
                  repeated at the next generation. He concluded that the F1 males were degenerate and sterile. However, as explained below,
                  his culture conditions may not have been optimal for mating.
               </p>
               <p>Hikokuro Honda tried to reproduce Maupas&#8217; experiments (<a href="#bib142">Honda, 1925</a>). He isolated <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> (likely this time in North America where he worked). He noticed that his <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> strain, even after having stopped producing fertile eggs for 24 hours, may still sometimes produce progeny&#8211;thus possibly
                  explaining why Maupas&#8217; mating experiments with old <span class="italic">R. marionis</span> and <span class="italic">R. duthiersi</span> hermaphrodites did produce progeny but only hermaphrodites. In <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, Honda did not obtain any males in his mating attempts. However, with <span class="italic">O. dolichura</span> he obtained males in the first generation. He correctly observed six bivalents in the oocytes and spermatids of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>.
               </p>
               <p>Nigon (Nigon, 943; <a href="#bib211">Nigon, 1946</a>; <a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>) was the one who succeeded in carrying out crosses reproducibly in species with hermaphrodites and rare males&#8211;<span class="italic">C. elegans</span> and <span class="italic">O. dolichura</span>. Nigon isolated <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> from garden soil in Bergerac, France (see <a href="#sec17" title="17.&nbsp;Appendix 2. The C. elegans Bergerac strain.">Appendix 2</a>, <a href="#sec17" title="17.&nbsp;Appendix 2. The C. elegans Bergerac strain.">Section 17</a> and <a href="#sec18" title="18.&nbsp;Appendix 3. Biographies">Appendix 3</a>, <a href="#sec18.4" title="18.4.&nbsp;Victor Marc Nigon (11 October 1920 - 5 July 2015)">Section 18.4</a>). In contrast to his predecessors, he maintained his cultures by isolating animals individually at each generation, on a
                  drop of agar on a slide (<a href="#sec2.1" title="2.1.&nbsp;Culture">Section 2.1</a>, <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>). When obtaining a rare male from an isolated hermaphrodite, he placed it with one of its sisters. In some cases, the offspring
                  was exclusively hermaphroditic&#8211;the males may have been sterile. In other cases, the progeny contained approximately the same
                  number of males and hermaphrodites. Most males of the second generation were fertile (93%) and again gave rise to both hermaphroditic
                  and male progeny. From the third generation, almost all males were fertile. Males could thus be propagated through crosses
                  at will.
               </p>
               <p>In summary, Maupas used group cultures of several (5-20) males with as many aged hermaphrodites. His spontaneous males obtained
                  from hermaphrodite self-fertilization were often fertile, while all males of the second generation seemed to be sterile. By
                  contrast, in Nigon's experiments, young males were associated with young hermaphrodites. The spontaneous males were often
                  sterile, but from the third generation, almost all were fertile.
               </p>
               <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
               <p>Why were the mating experiments successful in the hands of Nigon and not of his predecessors? Several factors may have contributed.
                  First and perhaps most importantly, the culture and mating conditions that Nigon set up were highly controlled and allowed
                  reproducible experiments, including crosses with single hermaphrodites and males, on an agar medium incubated in a humid chamber
                  (<a href="#sec2.1" title="2.1.&nbsp;Culture">Section 2.1</a>). In contrast, Maupas was culturing large populations in depression slides, in water to which rotten meat was added. Honda
                  also used a liquid medium, in which <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> males could perhaps not mate. Second, Maupas used aged hermaphrodites, which may have been too old to reproduce. The first
                  point is likely the main factor. The control of mating of males with hermaphodites is the basis for modern <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> genetics (<a href="#bib82">Dougherty, 1963</a>; <a href="#bib41">Brenner, 1974</a>).
               </p>
               <p>The odd three-sex situation described by Maupas in <span class="italic">Reiterina viguieri</span> has been found again in &#8221;<span class="italic">Rhabditis</span>&#8220; sp.

               <p>The use of crosses between males and hermaphrodites allowed the testing of cross-fertility between isolates from nature. The
                  lack of males in the progeny of a cross between males of strain A and hermaphrodites of strain B (or reciprocally) indicated
                  that the two strains were not cross-fertile. An absence of cross-fertility indicated the presence of two different species,
                  provided within-strain controls were positive. Maupas had attempted such hybridization tests between morphologically diverse
                  species, without success. Some matings between morphologically diverse species occurred with the deposition of a copulatory
                  plug, while a few yielded arrested embryos or gonadless adults (<a href="#bib187">Maupas, 1919</a>). Conversely, using a strain that was morphologically difficult to distinguish from the Bergerac isolate, Dougherty and Nigon
                  discovered through crosses a new species, which they named <span class="italic">C. briggsae.</span></p>
               <p>The new strain had been collected in 1944 by Margaret Briggs, then a student at Stanford University, using a peanut butter
                  enrichment procedure to initiate the culture (<a href="#bib86">Dougherty and Nigon, 1949</a>; <a href="#bib223">Nigon and Dougherty, 1949</a>; <a href="#bib46">Briggs Gochnauer and McCoy, 1954</a>; procedure described in <a href="#bib84">Dougherty and Calhoun, 1948b</a>). This culture was passed to E. Dougherty, who first called it &#8221;<span class="italic">R. elegans</span>&#8220; because of its close morphological similarity (<a href="#bib84">Dougherty and Calhoun, 1948b</a>). Briggs continued to work on <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> culture conditions, including its response to antibiotics (<a href="#bib46">Briggs Gochnauer and McCoy, 1954</a>). This strain is still available as <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=DR1690;class=Strain" target="_blank">DR1690</a> (<a href="#bib106">Fodor et al., 1983</a>; <a href="#bib189">McGrath et al., 2011</a>).
               </p>
               <p>By crossing the Berkeley strain to the <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> Bergerac strain, Nigon and Dougherty found no males in the progeny. In addition, using a <span class="italic">micro</span> (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">dumpy</a>) mutant (see <a href="#sec9.2" title="9.2.&nbsp;The first mutants">Section 9.2</a>) in the heterozygous state in males, they did not see the mutation segregate in the grandprogeny of hermaphrodites (<a href="#bib86">Dougherty and Nigon, 1949</a>; <a href="#bib223">Nigon and Dougherty, 1949</a>). Some phenotypic features of the two cultures were noticed: the Berkeley strain displayed a lighter color of intestinal
                  granules, a smaller number of embryos in the uterus, fusion of sensory male rays 3-4, and a slower growth at 12 &deg;C. Comparing
                  morphological measurements with those of Maupas for <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, they concluded that the California strain was the new species and they named it <span class="italic">Rhabditis briggsae</span> (<a href="#bib86">Dougherty and Nigon, 1949</a>), now <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis briggsae</span>. They concluded that there may be many cryptic species that cannot be distinguished morphologically in the genus <span class="italic">Rhabditis.</span></p>
               <p>The same procedure was used by Nigon to assign a new <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis</span> isolate from Bristol to <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>. The Bristol strain was isolated in 1951 from mushroom compost by Warwick Nicholas during a nematology course organized by
                  L. N. Staniland in Bristol (<a href="#bib208">Nicholas, 1975</a>; <a href="#bib140">Hodgkin and Doniach, 1997</a>; <a href="#bib189">McGrath et al., 2011</a>). This strain passed through the hands of nematologists such as Osche (<a href="#bib209">Nicholas et al., 1959</a>) and B. G. Chitwood (<a href="#bib123">Hansen et al., 1960</a>), and was definitively identified as <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> by Nigon, through positive hybridization to the Bergerac strain (<a href="#bib209">Nicholas et al., 1959</a>).
               </p>
               <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
               <p>As many more morphologically similar species of <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis</span> have been found, the biological species concept for species definition has been further implemented in the genus by Sudhaus
                  and Kiontke (2007) and F&eacute;lix et al. (2014). A gonochoristic <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis</span> species that is morphologically similar to <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> and <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> was described in 1974 as <span class="italic">C. remanei</span> (<a href="#bib295">Sudhaus, 1974</a>). Dozens of new gonochoristic species have been found since, as well as a third hermaphroditic species, <span class="italic">C. tropicalis</span> (<a href="#bib159">Kiontke et al., 2011</a>; F&eacute;lix et al., 2014). The finding of closely related species with partial hybridization properties has already allowed studies
                  of genetic incompatibility and speciation in <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis</span> to start (Woodruff et al., 2010).

               <p>Hermaphroditism in nematodes appeared to be independently derived several times from the gonochoristic mode via evolutionary
                  modification of the female germline (<a href="#bib186">Maupas, 1900</a>). This suggested that the evolutionary transition from one mode to another was easy.
               </p>
               <p>This idea was reinforced in later experiments by Hedwig Hirschmann on the gonochoristic <span class="italic">Pristionchus lheritieri</span> (then <span class="italic">Diplogaster lheritieri</span>) (<a href="#bib134">Hirschmann, 1951</a>). Hirschmann established parallel lines of <span class="italic">P. lheritieri</span> through inbreeding (brother x sister) of a strain she had isolated from nature; these lines rapidly decreased in fertility,
                  a case of inbreeding depression. In the F4-F5 generations, she observed some self-fertile animals as well as other types of
                  intersex individuals. With the self-fertile animals, she started a line that reproduced through self-fertile, protandrous
                  hermaphrodites and rare males. Four replicates of inbreeding confirmed this transition in reproductive mode.
               </p>
               <p>She described these selfing strains under a new species name, <span class="italic">&#8220;Diplogaster biformis&#8221;</span>. She also repeatedly isolated from nature selfing strains with a similar morphology. She tested a selfing strain for reproductive
                  isolation with <span class="italic">P. lheritieri,</span> and found that they did not produce cross-progeny. But it is unclear whether she used the selfing laboratory descendants
                  of <span class="italic">P. lheritieri</span> or the morphologically similar selfing species that she had found in nature (in fact likely <span class="italic">P. maupasi</span>, <a href="#bib232">Osche, 1954</a>; <a href="#bib311">Triantaphyllou and Hirschmann, 1964</a>). Thus, it is unclear whether the selfing species obtained by inbreeding was reproductively isolated from its gonochoristic
                  parent.
               </p>
               <p>Yet, her inbreeding experiment suggests that the evolutionary transition from obligate outcrossing to selfing may be obtained
                  in the laboratory, at least in some cases, when starting with natural populations of gonochoristic species.
               </p>
               <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
               <p>These findings have not been reproduced so far, but we now know that in the gonochoristic <span class="italic">C. remanei</span>, hermaphroditism can be obtained through targeted mutational change in just two independent pathways (Baldi et al., 2009).

               <p>Cultures of gonochoristic free-living nematodes generally contain the two sexes in approximately equal proportion based on
                  an XX/XY or XX/X0 chromosomal sex determination. The cytological study of chromosomes of free-living species by Nigon showed
                  either no difference in chromosome number between males and females (<span class="italic">Panagrolaimus rigidus</span>, <a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>), suggesting a XX/XY mechanism, or one less chromosome in males (<span class="italic">Pellioditis pellio</span>, <a href="#bib128">Hertwig, 1920</a>; <span class="italic">Pelodera strongyloides</span>, <a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>). During <span class="italic">P. strongyloides</span> spermatogenesis, all primary spermatocytes were observed to bear a single X and &#8220;reduction&#8221; of the X chromosome occurred
                  at the second meiotic division (<a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>). XX/X0 sex determination had been found previously in some parasitic nematode species, such as <span class="italic">Angiostomum nigrovenosa</span> (now called <span class="italic">Rhabdias bufonis</span>; <a href="#bib38">Boveri, 1911</a>; <a href="#bib266">Schleip, 1911</a>).

                  be examined in the following generations and were shown to carry one less chromosome than hermaphrodites (<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>). These results indicated that sex determination in hermaphroditic species had a chromosomal basis, with an XX/X0 system,
                  as in the related gonochoristic species. This XX/X0 system was observed for both <span class="italic">O. dolichura</span> (<a href="#bib211">Nigon, 1946</a>) and <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> (<a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>).

               <p>What about the chromosomal content of the rare males coming from self-fertilization of hermaphrodites? <a href="#bib213">Nigon (1949a)</a> found it impossible to both examine chromosome number in a male and test its fertility. Fertile males were likely X0 because
                  when crossed to hermaphrodites they gave rise to progeny of which half carried 11 chromosomes (X0) and the other half 12 chromosomes
                  (XX). What about the sterile males that were produced by selfing hermaphrodites, and to some extent by hermaphrodites, crossed
                  to a fertile male? Several experiments attempted to answer this question, including trying to visualize spermatogenesis in
                  the hermaphrodites and to obtain more males in the progeny of selfed females. Both are detailed below.
               </p>
               <p>A special behavior of one chromosome pair, likely the sex chromosomes, was observed during hermaphrodite spermatogenesis in
                  <span class="italic">O. dolichura</span> (<a href="#bib211">Nigon, 1946</a>; <a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>)<span class="italic">.</span> In some spermatocytes, a standard symmetrical separation of all bivalents (homologous chromosomes) took place at anaphase,
                  while in some others, separation of one bivalent was delayed. This delay could possibly result in this bivalent entirely segregating
                  into one daughter cell, or being lost in the residual body discarded during sperm maturation. Assuming that the delayed bivalent
                  corresponded to the X chromosome, one could thus obtain nullo-X spermatozoa. Their fusion to a normal oocyte would give an
                  egg with a single X, producing a male. To be sure of the identity of this delayed chromosome, a marker on this chromosome
                  would have been useful. A similar delay of one chromosome was also observed in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> at anaphase of meiosis I, but to a lesser extent (<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>C).
               </p>
               <p>Several methods were employed to induce a hermaphrodite to produce a higher incidence of males: submitting the hermaphrodites
                  to a heat shock (for example 25&deg;C for several hours) or treating them with a colchicine solution (<a href="#bib214">Nigon, 1949b</a>). When these treatments were applied during the spermatogenesis of hermaphrodites, they led to various chromosomal aberrations
                  that could be observed cytologically. The animals thus treated were often sterile, or had diminished fertility. The progeny
                  included many irregular cases (<a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>), including males, some of which were intersexual, a form already described by <a href="#bib186">Maupas (1900)</a>, or true female individuals with no trace of spermatogenesis. It may be hypothesized that these abnormalities resulted from
                  abnormal chromosomal contents. The absence of morphological differences or of gene markers among chromosomes was here again
                  the obstacle to further studies.

                  stages are aligned along the ovary in a single animal (<a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>; <a href="#bib221">Nigon and Brun, 1955</a>) (<a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>). Nigon and Brun observed that at the tip of the gonad, oogonia underwent mitotic divisions. The oocyte nuclei then entered
                  meiotic prophase I and transited from synapsis to diakinesis along the arm of the gonad (<a href="#bib221">Nigon and Brun, 1955</a>). Fertilization then triggered the two meiotic divisions and polar body formation.

               <p>Chromosome behavior during pairing and recombination was studied during oogenesis in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> (<a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>) (<a href="#bib221">Nigon and Brun, 1955</a>). Chromosomes were observed to synapse (pair) at the onset of meiotic prophase. One of them often appeared hypercondensed
                  (the X chromosome). After pachytene, the chromosomes entered a dispersed stage (now called the diffuse stage), most easily
                  seen in older adults. During diakinesis, the recombined homologs started separating, usually adopting a V-shape. The chromatids
                  then partially separated (tetrads). Further condensation resulted in two bivalents, which then migrated to opposite poles
                  of the first meiotic division. This scheme was somewhat different from that proposed for species with a distinct rather than
                  diffuse centromere (<a href="#bib68">Darlington, 1937</a>).
               </p>
               <p>The study of spermatogenesis in X0 males was performed by <a href="#bib213">Nigon (1949a)</a>, mostly using <span class="italic">O. dolichura</span>. As in <span class="italic">C. elegan</span>s, the diploid number of chromosomes was 12 in hermaphrodites, 11 in males. In the <span class="italic">O. dolichura</span> male, the first meiotic division was observed to be most often reductional for autosomes, but equational for the (haploid)
                  X chromosome, with each chromatid migrating to a different daughter cell at meiosis I (as in <span class="italic">Pelodera strongyloides</span>, <a href="#sec4.1" title="4.1.&nbsp;Chromosomal sex determination in gonochoristic species">Section 4.1</a>) (<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>C). Yet the anaphase migration of the X chromosomes was delayed compared to that of the autosomes&#8211;so much so that in some
                  cases, both chromatids were found in the same spermatocyte after the first division, in which case the equational segregation
                  occurred at the second division (<a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>).

               <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
               <p>Studies of meiosis in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> have largely developed in the last ten years (<a href="#bib256">Rog and Dernburg, 2013</a>; <a href="#bib179">Lui and Colaiacovo, 2013</a>). The dynamics of chromosome synapsis can be followed live (<a href="#bib257">Rog and Dernburg, 2015</a>). A single crossing-over occurs for each pair of homologous chromosomes in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> meiosis (<a href="#bib193">Meneely et al., 2002</a>), usually on a chromosome arm rather than in the center of the chromosome; the site of the unique crossing-over defines a
                  long and a short chromosomal arm. Specific protein complexes associate and regulate double-stranded breaks, crossovers, short
                  and long arms of chromosomes, and apposed homologs versus chromatids (<a href="#bib256">Rog and Dernburg, 2013</a>; <a href="#bib179">Lui and Colaiacovo, 2013</a>). The V shape (Y shape in <a href="#bib205">Nabeshima et al., 2005</a>) is transient in early diplotene, when the long arms but not the short arms have separated. When the short arm chromatids
                  separate, it becomes a tetrad (Chi or X shape; <a href="#bib205">Nabeshima et al., 2005</a>). Further condensation, especially of the short arm, results in the Phi shape described above, and finally a bivalent, where
                  the long arms are located outside and will attach to the spindle microtubules. Chromosomes in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> are holocentric, meaning that centromeres are diffuse and the microtubules contact a large part of the chromosome (<a href="#bib9">Albertson et al., 1997</a>; <a href="#bib10">Albertson and Thomson, 1993</a>; <a href="#bib273">Schvarzstein et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib191">Melters et al., 2012</a>).

                  <p>After heat shock of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, some of the progeny were of larger size than usual (<a href="#bib214">Nigon, 1949b</a>; <a href="#bib215">Nigon, 1951a</a>). A cytological study showed that these animals were tetraploids. They were self-fertile and their progeny were highly variable
                     in several respects: there were individuals of diverse sizes, hermaphrodites (fertile or sterile) and males, intersexes, arrested
                     larvae, etc.; some reverted to diploids, and in one such case, some animals resembled the <span class="italic">C. briggsae micro</span> mutant (<a href="#sec9.2" title="9.2.&nbsp;The first mutants">Section 9.2</a>); this Micro phenotype (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/species/all/phenotype/WBPhenotype:0000583#0--10" target="_blank">Dumpy</a>) could not be stabilized.
                  </p>
                  <p>This was an unprecedented experiment. In the animal kingdom, fertile lines of induced tetraploids had not been obtained so
                     far. A further aim was to know how long and under which conditions this polyploid form could be maintained. Starting from
                     a population with variable phenotypes, Nigon applied a simple selection, based on size and fecundity. After about 20 generations,
                     variability was lowered. During this first phase, unknown genome changes may have occurred. But variant forms reappeared at
                     each generation and the maintenance of polyploids still required selection to eliminate them. Tetraploidy could be maintained
                     for 78 generations, after which the culture was lost accidently. Nigon decided not to start again, lacking appropriate means
                     to study this interesting variable phenomenon.
                  </p>
                  <p>The male frequencies in the progeny of 426 tetraploid hermaphrodites displayed a bimodal distribution (<a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a>). The left side of the distribution corresponded to a class of individuals producing few males; this class was called thelygenous
                     (producing females). The right side of the graph revealed a class of individuals with a higher and more variable male proportion;
                     this class was called allelogenous (producing the alternative form).

                  <p>Further experiments showed that thelygenous parents could give rise to both thelygenous and allelogenous progeny, the latter
                     in small proportions. Allelogenous parents could also give rise to both types, but with a higher proportion of allelogenous

                     the parents of the next generation were selected in the corresponding class, thelygenous in one line, allelogenous in the
                     other. 30 generations of this treatment did not yield any differences in the stability of either line; the total of the counts

                     correspond to that of the eggs. As a reference, the diploid line produced approximately 0.2% males.

                  <p>The average length of thelygenous hermaphrodites was 1560 &micro;m, compared with 1300 &micro;m for diploids; the average length of allelogenous

Ratios between the respective volumes of body and egg sizes were thus similar for thelygenous

                     was further reduced, because they laid a higher proportion of dead eggs than thelygenous animals.

                  </div>
                  <p>Supposing that univalents were most often unpaired X chromosomes, one could infer that the hermaphrodite, of female morphology,
                     could be obtained with the standard tetraploid formula 4A+4X (where A stands for the five autosomes), as well as with 4A+3X,
                     4A+5X and 4A+6X. The chromosomal formula 4A+1X gave rise to males. The formula with 11 bivalents (which can be interpreted
                     as 4A+2X) usually gave rise to males, but might also give rise to hermaphrodites, likely because the abnormality concerned
                     another chromosome.
                  </p>
                  <p>These results suggested that the balance of X chromosomes to autosomes (X:A) determined sex, with the X chromosome exerting
                     a feminizing influence and the autosomes a masculinizing effect. In the normal hermaphrodite, the X:A ratio is 1, in the normal
                     male 0.5. Tetraploids allowed intermediate values: individuals with a X:A ratio of 0.75 developed as fertile hermaphrodites.
                     Some animals developed as intersex males. The critical X:A ratio was thus between 0.5 and 0.75, with some intersexes in the
                     intermediate range (<a href="#bib215">Nigon, 1951a</a>).
                  </p>
                  <p>The observations concerning the different forms of reproduction and sex determination led Nigon to discuss hypotheses concerning
                     the mechanisms of sex determination (<a href="#bib215">Nigon, 1951a</a>). We will limit ourselves here to two main directions:
                  </p>
                  <p>1) The activity of the X chromosome seemed to play an important role. However, the cytological identification of the sexual
                     chromosome often remained impossible. The study of tetraploids and various abnormalities induced by high temperature further
                     suggested that the sex chromosome acted in combination with other factors, some of which were carried by autosomes.
                  </p>
                  <p>2) The link between sex determination in the germ line and in the soma was not absolute, based on the fact that in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, one could find hermaphroditic gonads in male morphologies as well as in female morphologies. Put another way, the factors
                     that determine the somatic morphology could be separated from those leading to the sexual differentiation of gametes.
                  </p>
                  <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
                  <p>We saw above that Nigon solved the problems of crosses by developing an adequate and rigorous culture method. The choice of
                     an appropriate cytological method (<a href="#sec2.2" title="2.2.&nbsp;2.2. Cytological methods">Section 2.2</a>) was the result of the same methodological rigor. Most importantly, these cytological studies allowed Nigon to identify the
                     chromosomal basis of sex determination in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>.
                  </p>
                  <p><span class="bold"><strong>On X non-disjunction:</strong></span> Nigon observed that the spontaneous males obtained from hermaphrodites were more often sterile than the males obtained during
                     further generations of crosses. The partial sterility of the spontaneous males may be attributed to autosomal abnormalities
                     occurring concomitantly with X-chromosome non-disjunction. These other chromosomal abnormalities may lead to sterility and
                     thus be naturally eliminated in the following generations of crosses. Mutants with increased X-chromosome non-disjunction
                     (affecting chromosome pairing and synapsis) have since been found by screening for a high incidence of males (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/species/all/phenotype/WBPhenotype:0001175#0--10" target="_blank"><span class="italic">him</span></a>) in the progeny (<a href="#bib141">Hodgkin et al., 1979</a>). XXX animals that are produced as a counterpoint to X0 males are <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">dumpy</a> (short) and likely explain the unstable short animals produced by the tetraploid line. Most mutants with a high incidence
                     of males also affect autosomes and thereby result in a high proportion of dead, aneuploid progeny. The X chromosome has, however,
                     a specific pairing mechanism and its non-disjunction is specifically increased in some mutants (<a href="#bib141">Hodgkin et al., 1979</a>; <a href="#bib246">Phillips et al., 2005</a>). Whether most spontaneous non-disjunction of X chromosomes in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> hermaphrodites occurs in oogenesis (reduction division) (<a href="#bib141">Hodgkin et al., 1979</a>) or spermatogenesis (<a href="#bib193">Meneely et al., 2002</a>) still seems unclear. Reduction and lagging of the X chromosome during the first meiotic division in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> male spermatogenesis has been observed by <a href="#bib276">Shakes et al. (2009)</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p><span class="bold"><strong>On sex determination:</strong></span> Nigon established that <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> used a XX/X0 sex determination mechanism. How is the X chromosome counted? One important aspect of the chromosomal basis
                     of sex determination was Nigon's analysis of the tetraploid line. By using a combination of diploids and tetraploids in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, he correctly inferred that the sex of the individual was determined by the ratio between sex chromosomes and the other chromosomes:
                     the autosomes were participating in sex determination, as the denominator. Nigon's inference has since been validated and
                     further refined.
                  </p>
                  <p>A tetraploid line was later obtained from <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> Bristol after heat-shock by Madl and Herman (1979). This line included autosomal and X-linked marker mutations and is available
                     at the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC). Like Nigon, Madl and Herman found two types of hermaphrodites, which they called
                     LFM (low frequency of males, thelygenous; 4A+4X) and HFM (high frequency of males, allelogenous; 4A+3X), with unclassifiable
                     individuals. Madl and Herman (1979) confirmed the existence of diverse chromosomal formulas, also suggesting the presence
                     of autosomal aneuploids. In addition, they formed triploid individuals by crossing tetraploids and diploids and found that
                     3A+2X animals are males. They thus refined the critical ratio of X:A as lying between 0.67 and 0.75.
                  </p>
                  <p>Partial X-chromosome duplications further suggested that multiple loci on the X chromosome act in feminization (Madl and Herman,
                     1979). Several elements on the X chromosome and on the autosomes have now been identified as being involved in this counting,
                     thus proving the validity of the X:A ratio in determining sex (<a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_somaticsexdeterm/somaticsexdeterm.html" target="_blank">Somatic sex determination</a>).
                  </p>
                  <p>In addition, since variability and intersexes were observed, Nigon concluded that some other factors must be at play. This
                     variable expressivity likely corresponds to variation in activation of some components of the sex determination pathway in
                     different tissues of an individual.
                  </p>
                  <p><span class="bold"><strong>On tetraploidy:</strong></span> Nigon's tetraploid line corresponds to the first experimental induction and maintenance of tetraploidy in an animal (to our
                     knowledge). The instability of the tetraploid situation in meiosis was noted by the later authors (<a href="#bib182">Madl and Herman, 1979</a>; <a href="#bib192">Meneely, 1994</a>) but it was not further studied. Possibly, some chromosomal combinations are viable but display abnormalities. This variability
                     of the progeny of tetraploids is likely intrinsic to the situation of a meiotic prophase with four homologs, which might induce
                     a structural variability that is difficult to stabilize. Are plant tetraploids perhaps more stable due to a difference in
                     the mechanism of meiosis? An alternative is that self-fertilization may favor tetraploidy (Barringer, 2007) and is more common
                     in plants.
                  </p>
                  <p>A recent review on variations induced by polyploidy can be found in Wertheim et al. (2013). A key problem is the dosage of
                     gene expression in the presence of abnormal contents of chromosomes. In <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> diploids, it is now known that if any of the autosomes is haploid, the change in dosage results in lethality (<a href="#bib141">Hodgkin et al., 1979</a>). For the X chromosome, specific chromosomal dosage compensation mechanisms ensure a similar level of expression in hermaphrodites
                     and males (<a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_dosagecomp/dosagecomp.html" target="_blank">X-Chromosome dosage compensation</a>).

               <p>In true parthenogenesis, no sperm is involved. Among the species studied by <a href="#bib186">Maupas (1900)</a>, this mode of reproduction was found in <span class="italic">Rhabditophanes schneideri</span>, <span class="italic">Plectus cirratus,</span> and <span class="italic">Aphelenchus agricola</span>, as well as four new species he described: <span class="italic">Cephalobus dubius</span>, <span class="italic">Cephalobus lentus</span>, <span class="italic">Alaimus thamugadi,</span> and <span class="italic">Macrolaimus crucis</span> (<a href="#bib186">Maupas, 1900</a>). Maupas noted the absence of sperm in the ovary and the absence of males, which made it likely that these species were true
                  parthenogens. He did not further study the cytology of meiosis.
               </p>
               <p>In the animal kingdom, two subtypes of true parthenogenesis have been described, depending on the presence of chromosome pairing.
                  In both cases, the oocyte nucleus undergoes a single maturation division and generally emits a single polar body. In the first
                  subtype, the chromosomes are paired during oogenesis, and recombination can occur between them. In the second subtype, pairing
                  does not occur, and the single maturation division is equational, but apparently without recombination. Both meiotic and mitotic
                  parthenogeneses have been described in plant parasitic nematodes, such as <span class="italic">Meloidogyne</span> spp. (<a href="#bib311">Triantaphyllou and Hirschmann, 1964</a>). Karl B&#283;la&#345; (see <a href="#sec18.3" title="18.3.&nbsp;Karl Franz Joseph B&#283;la&#345; (1895-1931)">Section 18.3</a>) described the cytology of meiosis in free-living nematodes with true parthenogenesis, using a single, undescribed, species,
                  <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> XIX (<a href="#figure7">Figure 7</a>). This species displayed diakinesis and pairing, followed by separation of sister chromatids after anaphase. Here, in contrast
                  to usual female meiosis, focused centrosomes remained during meiosis (thus alleviating the need for a spermatozoon to provide
                  them) (<a href="#bib24">B&#283;la&#345;, 1923</a>; <a href="#bib25">B&#283;la&#345;, 1924</a>).

               <p>The second major mode of parthenogenesis requires a spermatozoon to activate the oocyte. The sperm chromosomal material then
                  degenerates without contributing to the genome of the progeny. This type of parthenogenesis, known as merospermy or pseudogamy,
                  can be further divided into three subtypes.

                  </div>
                  <p>The first subtype was described by Eva Kr&uuml;ger in a species she named <span class="italic">Rhabditis aberrans</span> (<a href="#bib163">Kr&uuml;ger, 1913</a>). This species was composed of somatic females producing sperm (apparent protandric hermaphroditism) and a particularly low
                     proportion of males (0.4 males for 1000 hermaphrodites). The sperm could be seen to enter the oocyte before the onset of the
                     oocyte maturation division and then rapidly degenerated. During the unique maturation division of the oocyte, a diploid stock
                     of 18 chromosomes could be observed, without pairing. At anaphase, the sister chromatids of the 18 unpaired chromosomes separated
                     and a single polar body was expelled. No second maturation division ensued. The diploid oocyte nucleus then moved towards
                     the egg center, and the first embryonic cleavage took place. In a single case, the author observed on living material the
                     extrusion of two polar bodies and the presence of two pronuclei. This possible true fertilization suggested an alternative
                     between parthenogenetic and amphimictic development, as described below for <span class="italic">Mesorhabditis</span> (<a href="#sec5.2.3" title="5.2.3.&nbsp;Pseudogamous gonochorism with partial true fertilization: Mesorhabditis spp.">Section 5.2.3</a>) and <span class="italic">Strongyloides</span> spp. (<a href="#sec8.2" title="8.2.&nbsp;Gonochoristic free-living and parthenogenetic parasitic generations: Strongyloides ratti">Section 8.2</a>).
                  </p>
                  <p>Spermatogenesis in <span class="italic">R. aberrans</span> hermaphrodites unfolded quite differently from oogenesis and overall in a standard fashion. At diakinesis, 8 bivalents and
                     2 univalent chromosomes (likely sex chromosomes) could be observed. On one occasion, the author observed 9 bivalents. The
                     first division was reductional for the bivalents, and equational for the univalents. At the second division, these previously
                     univalent chromosomes formed a bivalent and underwent a reduction division. In some cases, however, this bivalent separated
                     with a delay and a spermatid with 8 chromosomes and one with 10 were produced. This bivalent could also be lost at metaphase.
                     Thus, spermatogenesis appeared normal, albeit with some exceptions.
                  </p>
                  <p>Males could result from an abnormal maturation division of the oocyte or from an amphimictic fertilization by a sperm already
                     bearing a chromosomal abnormality, such as X0. In August 1911, Kr&uuml;ger obtained males at an average rate of 1.6% in a group
                     of six cultures, which lasted for only one generation, while other cultures at the same time produced males in the usual proportions.
                     This high male frequency may have been the consequence of a higher temperature.
                  </p>
                  <p>Kr&uuml;ger agreed with Maupas that the ability to reproduce without males was likely evolutionarily derived from a situation with
                     males and females. In natural settings, <span class="italic">R. aberrans</span>, like many free-living nematodes, went through periods of abundant food and fasting. Kr&uuml;ger suggested that hermaphroditism
                     and parthenogenesis might be advantageous in such circumstances because a single individual was able to reproduce.
                  </p>
                  <p>A pseudogamous hermaphroditic species he called <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> XX was further observed by <a href="#bib24">B&#283;la&#345; (1923)</a>. In this species as well, meiosis occurred differently in spermatogenesis versus oogenesis. In this species, only partial
                     chromosome pairing was observed during spermatogenesis.

                  <p>Paula Hertwig (see <a href="#sec18" title="18.&nbsp;Appendix 3. Biographies">Appendix 3</a>, <a href="#sec18.2" title="18.2.&nbsp;Paula Hertwig (1889-1983)">Section 18.2</a>) described the appearance of parthenogenesis as a &#8220;mutation&#8221; in a gonochoristic species<span class="italic">, Rhabditis pellio</span> (now <span class="italic">Pellioditis pellio</span>) (<a href="#bib128">Hertwig, 1920</a>). In January 1916, she isolated a male and a female of <span class="italic">P. pellio</span> from decomposing earthworms. This pair gave birth to an approximately equal number of male and female progeny. At some point,
                     the progeny from this single pair was divided into two cultures. At a later date, the author noticed that in one culture,
                     the population was composed of males and females in similar proportions, while, in the other, the population now contained
                     mostly females. Five days later, she isolated a few unfertilized young females from this male-poor culture and added three
                     males from the male-rich culture. These females produced only 12% males in their progeny, many of them with abnormal morphology.
                     Hertwig showed that the same male individual from the male-rich culture could fertilize females of both cultures, giving rise
                     to a 1:1 sex ratio or to a female-biased sex ratio, depending on the origin of the female. Male production continued to decrease
                     in the male-poor culture. Finally, after an unspecified time, the females produced only female progeny. The mutant culture
                     could then only be continued by addition of males from <span class="italic">R. pellio</span>. The conservation of this form thus required that both cultures be kept in parallel.
                  </p>
                  <p>Cytological observations indicated that the male-poor culture reproduced via pseudogamy. Oogenesis and spermatogenesis of
                     <span class="italic">P. pellio</span> normally took place with two standard maturation divisions, with pairing of 7 bivalents. In the pseudogamous form, the equatorial
                     plate of the unique oocyte maturation division displayed a diploid number of 14 chromosomes, without pairing. Cytology did
                     not suggest that the pseudogamous culture had undergone tetraploidization. The oocyte maturation division was triggered by
                     entry of the sperm from the male. As in <span class="italic">R. aberrans</span>, the sperm did not participate in the formation of a fertilization nucleus in the pseudogamous form of <span class="italic">P. pellio</span> (<a href="#figure8">Figure 8</a>).

While two
                           pronuclei (female and male) are formed in the wild form, the sperm nucleus stays condensed and does not participate to the
                           development of the pseudogamous form (arrow).

                  </div>
                  <p>To demonstrate the absence of genetic contribution from the sperm in this strain, Hertwig performed a further experiment:
                     she irradiated males with radium so as to inactivate their genetic material. These males remained able for several hours after
                     irradiation to mate and provide sperm, but the irradiated sperm chromosomes were degraded in the egg. If the females came
                     from the normal form, the eggs did not develop past the few first cleavage divisions. If the females were from the pseudogamous
                     line, the eggs developed normally. This demonstrated that, in the latter line, the genetic material from the male was not
                     required for development. This uncoupled the two roles of sperm, on one hand in triggering oocyte meiosis and subsequent embryonic
                     development, and on the other hand in providing genetic material.
                  </p>
                  <p>After collecting further nematodes in earthworms, Hertwig reported on finding pseudogamous forms of three species in nature.
                     She gave the name <span class="italic">Rhabditis anomala</span> to the natural pseudogamous species, stating that it might be equivalent to <span class="italic">R. aberrans</span> from Eva Kr&uuml;ger (<a href="#bib128">Hertwig, 1920</a>; <a href="#bib129">Hertwig, 1922</a>).

                  <p>A third form of pseudogamy was discovered by B&#283;la&#345; (<a href="#bib24">B&#283;la&#345;, 1923</a>; <a href="#bib25">B&#283;la&#345;, 1924</a>). In this case, the cultures contained 5 to 20% males. From live observations, B&#283;la&#345; noticed two types of eggs. In the first
                     type, the sperm chromosomes that had been provided by the male degenerated in the egg (<a href="#figure9">Figure 9</a>). In the vicinity of the degenerating sperm nucleus, were two centrosomes, from which asters grew. B&#283;la&#345; used oxygen depletion
                     to slow down movements in the cytoplasm and better visualize the growing asters and the origin of the centrosomes. The asters could
                     thus be clearly seen as originating from the region where the sperm entered. The female pronucleus moved towards them and
                     these asters formed the first mitotic spindle. The second type of egg underwent two oocyte maturation divisions; a male pronucleus
                     was formed and fused with the female pronucleus, following the course of usual meiosis and fertilization. This species thus
                     used both pseudogamous and amphimictic reproduction. In the pseudogamous form, the male sperm did not contribute genetic material,
                     but brought the centrosome. B&#283;la&#345; suggested that the amphimictic eggs gave rise to males.

                  <p>B&#283;la&#345;, with the help of Micoletzky, identified the species as <span class="italic">Rhabditis monhystera</span> B&uuml;tschli, whose males were at the time of B&uuml;tschli unknown. <a href="#bib213">Nigon (1949a)</a> studied the morphology of both sexes in a species collected from nature, where the females were morphologically similar but
                     not identical to <span class="italic">R. monhystera</span> B&uuml;tschli. This species displayed males, like that used by B&#283;la&#345;. Nigon thus considered that both his and B&#283;la&#345;'s culture
                     were a distinct species from that of B&uuml;tschli, and named it <span class="italic">Rhabditis belari</span> (now <span class="italic">Mesorhabditis belari</span>).
                  </p>
                  <p>Nigon further studied <span class="italic">M. belari</span> using experiments and cytological observations (<a href="#bib212">Nigon, 1947</a>; <a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>). Spermatogenesis was difficult to follow in males because of the small cell size and the high chromosome number, yet overall
                     appeared similar to that of a normal gonochoristic species. 10 pairs of chromosomes were observed at diakinesis. One pair
                     contained a chromosome that was larger than all others, possibly a Y chromosome. The first division was reductional. At the
                     second division, 10 chromosomes moved in a synchronous manner. The large chromosome was found in some spermatocytes.
                  </p>
                  <p>In amphimictic eggs of <span class="italic">M. belari</span> with two pronuclei, Nigon observed that two polar bodies were emitted at the equator. The female pronucleus then appeared
                     next to them, while the sperm nucleus appeared at one pole (<a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>). Such eggs, with two pronuclei, were fixed under the microscope at the time of pronuclear meeting. Staining showed that
                     each pronucleus contained a haploid set of chromosomes. These oocytes had undergone a normal maturation with reduction.
                  </p>
                  <p>In pseudogamous eggs instead, Nigon observed that oogenesis conformed to the equational scheme described by B&#283;la&#345;, while the
                     sperm genetic material degenerated. In most pseudogamous eggs, the oocyte chromosomes formed a metaphase circle of 10 chromosome
                     pairs. The sister chromatids, already dissociated during anaphase, yielding 20 chromosomes. More rarely, a metaphase plate
                     with 20 unpaired chromosomes formed directly (<a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>). A single polar body was emitted. As suggested by <a href="#bib68">Darlington (1937)</a>, the timing of tetrad separation seemed the key factor that distinguished pseudogamous from amphimictic oocytes.

                  <p>Nigon followed fertilization in live eggs and could separate those showing one or two pronuclei. Out of 99 isolated eggs,
                     80 developed with a single pronucleus and 19 with two. From 25 eggs of the former class, development was followed until the
                     adult stage, which was reached for 19 of them, giving rise to 19 females. In contrast, 10 amphimictic eggs with two pronuclei
                     gave rise to 7 males and 3 females (which may correspond to a 1:1 ratio determined by chromosomal content). Thus, contrary
                     to B&#283;la&#345;'s supposition, the amphimictic eggs gave rise to both males and females, whereas the parthenogenetic ones only gave
                     rise to females. From the asymmetric size of one chromosome pair in the males, sex determination seems to follow a XX/XY scheme.
                  </p>
                  <p>To determine the proportion of sexes, 11 male-female pairs were isolated and gave rise to a total of 631 males and 5559 females,
                     thus a mean of 10.2% males (range 3-17%). In another experiment, pairs were isolated and transferred every two days in order
                     to examine variation as a function of age, and the cultures were maintained at four temperatures ranging from 13-25&deg;C. At
                     all temperatures, the proportion of males decreased progressively with maternal age, from 19 to 6% at 13 &deg;C, from 13 to 3%
                     at 17 &deg;C and beyond. Addition of old medium decreased the male frequency from 19 to 12. These variations in sex ratio likely
                     corresponded to variations in the proportion of amphimictic eggs. In summary, in this species, the amphimictic or parthenogenetic
                     nature of reproduction appeared to depend on oocyte constitution, itself influenced by age, temperature and culture medium
                     (<a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>; <a href="#bib217">Nigon, 1952</a>). The sperm nucleus behavior then correlated with that of the oocyte nucleus.

                  <p>The variety of reproductive modes of free-living nematodes has great potential for studies on the evolution and impact of
                     reproductive modes. Pseudogamy is found in other organisms (<a href="#bib28">Beukeboom and Vrijenhoek, 1998</a>), but has not been studied in nematodes since the work reported above.
                  </p>
                  <p>We are not aware of any species in present culture with the pseudogamous hermaphrodite mode of reproduction described for
                     <span class="italic">R. aberrans</span>, except perhaps <span class="italic">Protorhabditis</span> sp. JB122, which develops parthenogenetically (<a href="#bib39">Brauchle et al., 2009</a>), yet the females make sperm (M.-A. F&eacute;lix, unpublished observations). In addition, pseudogamy may simply have been overlooked
                     in species labeled &#8220;hermaphroditic&#8221; in culture collections. The modalities of gamete maturation are widely different in oogenesis
                     and spermatogenesis of the same hermaphroditic <span class="italic">R. aberrans</span> individual. How meiosis is regulated differently in the two types of gamete remains unknown.
                  </p>
                  <p>The observation by <a href="#bib128">Hertwig (1920)</a> of a &#8220;mutation&#8221; of the gonochoristic <span class="italic">P. pellio</span> into a pseudogamous form is intriguing, especially the fact that the mutation seems to have a correlated effect on female
                     meiosis and sperm degeneration. The transformation appeared progressively over generations, perhaps through stabilization
                     of an abnormal chromosome content or fixation of new or pre-existing mutations in the culture. These experiments would need
                     to be reproduced on the same species or another, either by further sampling of <span class="italic">P. pellio</span> or by using induced mutagenesis or heat-shock. Whether this phenomenon is relevant in nature also remains to be explored.
                  </p>
                  <p><span class="italic">Mesorhabditis</span> <span class="italic">belari,</span> with its alternative mode of egg development, is particularly intriguing. Among species presently in culture, <span class="italic">Mesorhabditis</span> sp. PS1179 displays this mode of reproduction, which allows one to study the regulation of pseudogamy versus true fertilization
                     in a given individual (M. Delattre and M.-A. F&eacute;lix, unpublished).
                  </p>
                  <p>Even true parthenogenetic free-living nematodes have been little studied. True parthenogens are found in genera in the sister
                     clade to <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis</span>, such as <span class="italic">Diploscapter</span> (<a href="#bib39">Brauchle et al., 2009</a>), the <span class="italic">Panagrolaimus</span>, <span class="italic">Halicephalobus</span>, <span class="italic">Rhabditophanes</span> and <span class="italic">Cephalobus</span>/<span class="italic">Acrobeloides</span> genera (Cephalobina suborder), and aquatic species such as <span class="italic">Plectus</span> sp. The species <span class="italic">Diploscapter coronatus</span> (Rhabditidae) contains a single chromosome pair, which undergoes a single meiotic division without pairing (although the
                     polar body later divided; <a href="#bib127">Hechler, 1968</a>; <a href="#bib164">Lahl et al., 2006</a>). In <span class="italic">Acrobeloides nanus</span> (Cephalobidae), a second meiotic division was observed but the two daughter cells then fused. <span class="italic">Plectus</span> sp. ES601 (Plectidae) produces two polar bodies; whether diploidy is achieved in this species through an additional round
                     of DNA replication is unclear (<a href="#bib164">Lahl et al., 2006</a>). A better understanding of genetic segregation in parthenogens has been only achieved in some plant parasitic nematodes,
                     such as <span class="italic">Meloidogyne hapla</span> (<a href="#bib172">Liu et al., 2007</a>).
                  </p>
                  <p>Overall, this diversity of reproductive mode in free-living nematodes that are easy to culture in the laboratory opens up
                     exciting possibilities of studies on their cell biological regulation and evolutionary context.

            <p>The basis of our knowledge on descriptive and experimental embryology in nematodes derives mostly from studies of <span class="italic">Parascaris equorum</span> performed between 1890 and 1910. A synthesis can be found in <a href="#bib219">Nigon (1965)</a>. The clear-sightedness of these early embryological studies, on par with those performed on sea urchins or amphibians then
               classical materials for embryologists, left far behind the few observations made on free-living nematodes, where the early
               embryonic divisions, as in <span class="italic">Ascaris</span>, separate cells of different potentials and fates.

               <p><a href="#bib226">Nigon et al. (1960)</a> observed the early stages of development on living embryos in several free-living species: <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, <span class="italic">M. belari</span>, <span class="italic">R. anomala</span>, and <span class="italic">R. maupasi</span>. Using a camera mounted on the microscope, the behavior of the egg was recorded in time lapse. The first events following
                  sperm entry had to be studied on eggs that were still in the female uterus, because at this stage the egg shell is under formation
                  and does not sufficiently protect the embryo. Observations become easier later in development when the eggs can be isolated.
                  The use of an incubator case for the microscope made it possible to vary the temperature (see <a href="#figure22">Figure 22</a>). Although embryo development was analyzed until the four-cell stage, we will here mostly report on events from sperm entry
                  until first cleavage.
               </p>
               <p>In free-living nematodes, the anatomy of the ovary and uterus made it possible to distinguish in the elongated shape of the
                  mature oocyte a proximal or external pole, towards the vulva, and a distal or internal pole, towards the distal germ line.
                  [These poles were called anterior and posterior, respectively, in the article by <a href="#bib226">Nigon et al. (1960)</a>. Because the modern reader may be used to the reverse nomenclature, we use here proximal and distal in reference to the orientation
                  in the gonad and restrict anterior and posterior to their current use, which corresponds to the anterio-posterior axis in
                  embryonic development (animal-vegetal).] A key question concerned the appearance of cells of different developmental fates
                  and the control of embryonic cleavage patterns during the early embryonic divisions. Each species was seen to elaborate specific
                  variants on a background of mostly common events. In gonochoristic and hermaphroditic species, sperm entry occurred most often
                  at the proximal pole (the future posterior embryonic pole). We will first describe the case of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> in some detail, then examine the observed particularities of other species more briefly.

                     membrane, and later, of the egg shell. The egg cytoplasm retracted inside the egg shell. The surface of the cytoplasm changed
                     its aspect continuously, forming bulges and grooves. The cytoplasm moved around in all directions. Movements appeared to be
                     driven by modifications (contraction or expansion) that originated in a superficial structure at the level of the plasma membrane

                  <p>At fertilization, the oocyte nuclear membrane was observed to break down, while the nucleus migrated slowly towards the anterior
                     pole. The first maturation division then took place, and the egg shell started forming. About 10 minutes later, the plasma
                     membrane became depressed at the anterior pole, where the second polar body formed. The female pronucleus appeared next to
                     this polar body, while the male pronucleus appeared close to the posterior pole (<a href="#figure11">Figure 11</a>a). Many in-folds and protuberances were observed at the egg surface, while the cytoplasm underwent streaming. A strong constriction
                     appeared at the posterior third of the egg, dividing the egg into two lobes. Because the egg seemed to be divided, this constriction
                     was called a pseudomembrane (pseudocleavage; <a href="#figure11">Figure 11</a>). A constriction could be seen to start, retract, then was followed by another one. Finally, several such small contractions
                     joined and surrounded the egg, and the pseudomembrane developed. The superficial deformations were at this time limited to
                     the anterior part of the egg. The pseudomembrane moved towards the anterior pole, triggering a cytoplasmic stream from the
                     anterior pole, flowing through the opening of the pseudomembrane towards the posterior pole. This flow dragged the female
                     pronucleus towards the male pronucleus. The pseudomembrane started fading when it only encased at the anterior pole one third
                     of the egg volume. Symmetrical figures of asters were observed to form on either side of the male pronucleus (<a href="#figure11">Figure 11</a>f). The asters then separated from each other, while the two pronuclei got closer to each other, towards the center of the
                     egg. After nuclear envelope breakdown, the mitotic spindle formed along the egg long axis, with an asymmetric position towards
                     the posterior pole. The asters then underwent four to nine oscillations (<a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>a). The surface of the cytoplasm only displayed minimal movements at this time.

                     located slightly posterior to the equator of the egg. A sharp incision progressively circled around the egg. Cytoplasmic granules
                     in contact with the membrane were carried along with membrane elongation; using time-lapse movies, granule movement was seen
                     to occur through successive waves. The egg division thus separated an animal cell at the anterior pole from a smaller vegetal
                     cell at the posterior pole. The second division then occurred with a rotation of the spindle in the posterior blastomere (<a href="#figure13">Figure 13</a>).

                  <p>In this hermaphroditic pseudogamous species, the single maturation division was observed at the anterior pole, where the polar
                     body remained visible (<a href="#bib226"><a href="#bib226">Nigon et al., 1960</a></a>). The surface deformations and cytoplasmic streams already started before the maturation division. No pseudomembrane was
                     formed. In a last phase before the division, movements of membrane and cytoplasm were limited to the distal pole before stopping
                     completely. The pronucleus moved slowly towards the center of the egg, before the asters grew. During this movement, the membrane
                     flowed, thereby carrying along the polar body towards the equator. The mitotic spindle appeared in a transverse axis. The
                     spindle then underwent oscillations, elongated and thus aligned along the egg long axis (<a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>b-d). Exceptionally, the spindle could form when the two asters were already positioned along the egg axis; in this case,
                     the polar body did not move.

                  <p>Another interesting observation was made on this species and a related species, <span class="italic">R. maupasi.</span> During spindle elongation, cytoplasmic regions devoid of cytoplasmic granules were formed at both poles, giving the cytoplasm
                     a hyaline appearance. Similar observations had been made in <span class="italic">Parascaris</span> by Pasteels (1948), who called these zones polar caps. He noted that at their level pyroninophilic material, likely rich
                     in RNA, was concentrated. These caps could not be seen in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, perhaps being masked in this species by the high density of granular structures in the cytoplasm.

The initial reorganization of the cytoskeleton triggered by sperm entry at the posterior cortex and the ensuing actin-network

The cortical movements result in the differential segregation of molecular determinants of cell fates in the two first blastomeres
                     (<a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_asymcelldiv.2/asymcelldiv.2.html" target="_blank">Polarity establishment, asymmetric division and segregation of fate determinants in early <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> embryos</a>). Using mutants defective in egg polarization (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/resources/gene_class/par#01--10" target="_blank"><span class="italic">par</span></a> mutants), a conserved set of cortical molecules involved in the polarity of many cell types has been discovered. Key conserved
                     molecular players in fundamental cell biological processes such as centriole duplication were also found in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> early embryos. This includes the discovery of the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE16647;class=Protein" target="_blank">SAS-6</a> protein that forms the basis for the 9-fold symmetry of centrioles (<a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_celldivision/celldivision.html" target="_blank">Cell division</a>; <a href="#bib116">G&ouml;nczy, 2012</a>; <a href="#bib133">Hilbert et al., 2013</a>). Also studied are the forces controlling the oscillations of the asters described above (<a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_asymcelldiv.2/asymcelldiv.2.html" target="_blank">Polarity establishment, asymmetric division and segregation of fate determinants in early <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> embryos</a>).

                  <p>In <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> and many other rhabditids, the embryonic antero-posterior axis is set by the sperm entry point<span class="italic">,</span> even when the sperm entry point is manipulated experimentally (<a href="#bib114">Goldstein and Hird, 1996</a>). By contrast, in <span class="italic">Panagrellus redivivus</span>, <span class="italic">Acrobeloides nanus,</span> and other nematodes of the Panagrolaimidae and Cephalobidae families, the sperm entry point does not predict the posterior
                     pole (<a href="#bib113">Goldstein et al., 1998</a>). In this case, the direction of the oocyte in the ovary is such that the future anterior pole is towards the vulva, thus
                     the reverse from the usual case in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> (<a href="#bib113">Goldstein et al., 1998</a>). These nematode families contain several truly parthenogenetic groups, where sperm is absent and thus cannot be used for
                     polarity establishment. The family Rhabditidae includes true parthenogenesis in the genus <span class="italic">Diploscapter</span>. In this case, the orientation of the embryo axis relative to the orientation of the oocyte in the gonad is random (<a href="#bib164">Lahl et al., 2006</a>); how the axis is established remains unclear. An extensive study of character evolution at different steps in early cell
                     polarity establishment has been performed (<a href="#bib39">Brauchle et al., 2009</a>).

               <p>The early cell lineage and the adult cell content of specific organs were shown to be invariant in a given species, first
                  when mostly parasitic nematode species were studied (<a href="#bib184">Martini, 1923</a>), and later on the free-living species <span class="italic">Anguillula aceti</span> (now <span class="italic">Turbatrix aceti</span>, family Panagrolaimidae; <a href="#bib240">Pai, 1928</a>). After a first phase of fast cleavage divisions during embryonic development, cell divisions stop. Then comes a phase when
                  cell types differentiate and organs are formed, without production of new cells. Individuals of the same species have an invariant
                  number of cells in a given organ; this stability in cell number has been called eutely (<a href="#bib184">Martini, 1923</a>).
               </p>
               <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
               <p>That the entire somatic cell lineage is mostly invariant has been unequivocally demonstrated by following the entire cell
                  lineage from zygote to adult (<a href="#bib300">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</a>; <a href="#bib157">Kimble and Hirsh, 1979</a>; <a href="#bib302">Sulston et al., 1983</a>). Development is mostly reproducible in terms of cell division patterns and cell fates. The reproducibility of the cell lineage
                  suggested to Brenner, Sulston, et al. that each cell computed its fate according to its position in the lineage rather than
                  its spatial position in the embryo (<a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>). Yet this was soon found to be only partially the case since, by the 4-cell stage, cell fates turned out to be specified
                  via signaling between cells. Cell fate specification is now known to occur through a combination of: 1) asymmetric divisions,
                  as that initiated by sperm entry; and 2) intercellular signaling between cells. Reproducible patterns of cell contacts render
                  the cell lineage basically invariant (<a href="#bib268">Schnabel and Priess, 1997</a>; <a href="#bib267">Schnabel, 1997</a>). The mechanisms behind the reproducibility of cell fates are thus relatively well understood, but the regulation of cell
                  cycles in the different sublineages less so.
               </p>
               <p>Although quite invariant in a species, the early cell divisions, the cell lineage, and the partitioning of cell fates (e.g.,
                  gut) varies among species (<a href="#bib291">Sternberg and Horvitz, 1981</a>; <a href="#bib292">Sternberg and Horvitz 1982</a>; <a href="#bib302">Sulston et al., 1983</a>; <a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_embryovariationdevelop/embryovariationdevelop.html" target="_blank">Embryological variation during nematode development</a>; <a href="#bib145">Houthoofd et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib272">Schulze and Schierenberg, 2011</a>; <a href="#bib265">Schiffer et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib171">Lin et al., 2009</a>).

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>Post-embryonic development has been the focus of the first article on nematodes by Maupas, who studied the number of molts
               and the dauer lifecycle, which he called &#8220;enkystment&#8221; (<a href="#bib185">Maupas, 1899</a>).
            </p>
            <p>Maupas followed postembryonic development and molts in 13 species (<a href="#bib185">Maupas, 1899</a>). At hatching, all organs were formed, except for the genital apparatus, which was built progressively during post-embryonic
               development. During each molt, a layer of cuticle was shed and rapidly degraded. Maupas observed four molts in all species,
               in contrast to previous authors who had reported various numbers of molts.
            </p>
            <p>Maupas also studied the alternative lifecycle through the resistance form (<a href="#bib185">Maupas, 1899</a>). If the animals were deprived of food, for example by letting them hatch inside their mother's body, he observed that &#8220;kysts&#8221;
               were formed at the end of the L2 stage, which could persist for several months. In the absence of food, all animals ended
               up dying except for these enkysted larvae. Maupas noticed that only the second molt could give rise to an enkysted larva.
               The enkysted larva was able to move and had a characteristic behavior, and Maupas inferred that this form was a migration
               and resistance stage. Some of these enkysted larvae adopted an original transportation mode on other animals; if the host
               died, they could proliferate on its decomposing corpse. Maupas observed the enkysted dauer form in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> and several other free-living nematodes, but not, for example, in the <span class="italic">Cephalobus</span> genus. In this latter genus instead, animals were able to dessicate and &#8220;revive&#8221; if humidity was restored (<a href="#bib185">Maupas, 1899</a>).
            </p>
            <p>Further variations in post-embryonic development of a given species were noted by Hedwig Hirschmann. She studied dimorphism
               in mouth morphology in <span class="italic">P. lheritieri</span> (a gonochoristic species) and a selfing species with rare males, likely <span class="italic">P. maupasi</span> (<a href="#bib134">Hirschmann, 1951</a>) (see above, <a href="#sec3.2" title="3.2.&nbsp;Variation in hermaphroditism among different species">Section 3.5</a>). Hirschmann noted that in a given culture, the adult buccal cavity might adopt either the Stenostoma (or St) form or the
               Eurystoma (or Eu) form. Larvae all showed a St mouth until the last molt, but in their last larval stage, some individuals
               underwent a change in mouth morphology to the Eu form, with a wider buccal cavity and additional teeth. The proportion of
               the Eu form changed with the environmental conditions, increasing in low food and highly crowded conditions. Yet it decreased
               upon passage through the dauer form (<a href="#bib134">Hirschmann, 1951</a>). In addition, the proportion of the two forms in a given environmental condition varied among different natural isolates
               of a species. This dimorphism appeared thus to be influenced by the environment and perhaps as well by genetic variation in
               the species.
            </p>
            <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
            <p>The temporal succession of post-embryonic stages and molts are now better understood. Genetic screens for developmental mutants
               in the Brenner and Horvitz laboratories yielded &#8220;heterochronic&#8221; mutants, in which the temporal succession of larval stages
               was altered. These mutants led to the discovery of micro-RNAs, a widespread and conserved mechanism of gene regulation (<span class="italic">C. elegans</span> microRNAs). Other aspects of post-embryonic development, such as vulva development (<a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_vulvaldev/vulvaldev.html" target="_blank">Vulval development</a>), are also now textbook examples in developmental biology.
            </p>
            <p>Free-living nematodes have been a model since the 1980s to study the evolution of development, based first on comparing the
               pattern of post-embryonic and embryonic cell lineages (<a href="#bib291">Sternberg and Horvitz, 1981</a>, <a href="#bib292">Sternberg and Horvitz, 1982</a>; <a href="#bib302">Sulston et al., 1983</a>; <a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_embryovariationdevelop/embryovariationdevelop.html" target="_blank">Embryological variation during nematode development</a>; <a href="#bib145">Houthoofd et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib272">Schulze and Schierenberg, 2011</a>; <a href="#bib265">Schiffer et al., 2014</a>), then on cell ablation, genetic, and molecular studies (<a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_evoldevnematode/evoldevnematode.html" target="_blank">Evolution of development in nematodes related to <span class="italic">C. elegans</span></a>).
            </p>
            <p>The alternative developmental paths&#8211;dauer entry vs. direct development&#8211;have become a key example of plasticity in animal development
               that is induced by some environmental parameters. Also, following genetic screens, the alternative choice could be dissected
               at the molecular and cellular levels (see the WormBook chapter, <a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_dauer/dauer.html" target="_blank">Dauer</a>). The <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> dauer larva is particularly relevant to the study of the infective larva of parasitic nematodes (<a href="#bib67">Crook, 2014</a>). Note that Maupas seems to have confused two phenomena: on one hand the dauer larva, which is a third stage larva in its
               dauer cuticle; on the other hand, the situation where in some rhabditid species the dauer larva remains in a tube formed by
               the undegraded L2 cuticle. The latter occurs in many rhabditid groups, but not in <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis</span> where the L2 cuticle is shed and degraded (<a href="#bib296">Sudhaus, 2011</a>).

            <p>Studies of the dimorphism in <span class="italic">Pristionchus</span> mouth forms have recently resumed in the <span class="italic">Pristionchus</span> genus (<a href="#bib26">Bento et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib32">Bose et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib56">Bumbarger et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib251">Ragsdale et al., 2013</a>).

            <p>Some nematode species display both free-living and parasitic generations, often with different reproductive modes. These species
               likely derive from free-living nematodes. The alternation of generations constitutes in itself an interesting subject: with
               the same genome, two forms with different development, morphologies, modes of reproduction, behaviors, and lifespans coexist
               (<a href="#bib217">Nigon and Roman, 1952</a>). When comparing the morphology of free-living and parasitic forms of the same species, large differences could be observed
               (length varying from 1 to 3 fold or even 1 to 10 fold; much longer lifespan of the parasitic generation; in some cases, extreme
               modification of the parasitic form). We will here focus on the alternation in their reproductive mode, including gametogenesis
               and fertilization.

                  </div>
               </div>
               <p>The first important studies dealing with the chromosomal determination of sex and the alternation of generations were conducted
                  by <a href="#bib38">Boveri (1911)</a> and <a href="#bib266">Schleip (1911)</a> on <span class="italic">Rhabditis nigrovenosa</span> (now called <span class="italic">Rhabdias bufonis),</span> a nematode species that parasitizes amphibians. The parasitic generation of this species is composed of protandrous hermaphrodites,
                  who give birth to a free-living gonochoristic generation, which in turn produces eggs that develop into infective larvae.
                  Thus, with the alternation of parasitic and free-living forms, the modes of reproduction also alternate, from hermaphroditic
                  to gonochoristic. Given an apparent chromosomal sex determination, two problems arise: how can a hermaphrodite give rise to
                  both females and males, and conversely how can females and males give rise to hermaphroditic &#8220;females&#8221; only?
               </p>
               <p>The parasitic hermaphrodites of <span class="italic">Rhabdias bufonis</span> display a diploid number of 12 chromosomes in their mitotic germ line. After two normal maturation divisions, the oocyte
                  contains a standard haploid content of 6 chromosomes. Spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites is more complex, producing spermatozoa
                  with 6 or 5 chromosomes. How can a hermaphrodite with 12 chromosomes give rise to these two kinds of sperm? According to Boveri,
                  spermatogenesis may entail the loss of one chromosome (as in <span class="italic">O. dolichura</span>, see <a href="#sec3" title="3.&nbsp;Hermaphroditism: selfing and crossing with males">Section 3</a> and <a href="#sec4.2" title="4.2.&nbsp;Chromosomal sex determination in hermaphroditic species">Section 4.2</a>). In contrast, according to Schleip, the maturation of spermatocytes proceeds normally, giving rise to spermatids with 6
                  chromosomes, and it is only during the transformation of spermatids into spermatozoa that one chromosome would be degraded
                  in some spermatids, producing spermatozoa with 5 chromosomes. In any case, fusion of these gametes gives rise to the free-living
                  generation: those with 12 chromosomes are females, while those with 11 are males.
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the second question, the authors stated that in the free-living generation, gamete formation occurred normally,
                  with two maturation divisions. They thus gave rise to oocytes with 6 chromosomes in the females and sperm with 5 or 6 chromosomes
                  in the male. The development of hermaphroditic &#8220;females&#8221; only in the next generation (parasitic) would derive from the fact
                  that spermatozoa bearing 5 chromosomes were inactive. This last conclusion was hypothetical.

               <p>In parasitic females, the mitotic zone of the ovary shows a diploid stock of 6 chromosomes, which do not pair in early meiosis.
                  The oocytes develop in a parthenogenetic mode without fertilization, with a single maturation division. Parasitic parthenogenetic
                  females give birth to rhabditiform larvae that escape through the host feces (stercoral generation).
               </p>
               <p><a href="#bib227">Nigon and Roman (1952)</a> found that the development of the next generation depended on external factors:
               </p>
               <p>1). If the larvae were cultured on an agar medium, only males reached the adult stage. They represented approximately 0.5%
                  of the population. The other larvae developed into filariform infective larvae, which might infect rats when applied to their
                  skin. Some of them would reach the intestine and further develop into parasitic females.
               </p>
               <p>2). If the larvae were raised in coproculture (on feces), the production of males was not modified, but adult females were
                  also formed in a number similar to that of males<span class="italic">.</span> This free-living generation was composed of two sexes. The remainder (i.e., 99% of the progeny of the parasite) developed
                  into infective larvae.

               <p>In the free-living generation, females displayed a diploid stock of 6 chromosomes, and the males only had 5. Non-disjunction

                  given that non-disjunction should only take place in 0.5% of the meioses.
               </p>
               <p>In the oocytes of free-living females, <a href="#bib227">Nigon and Roman (1952)</a> observed 3 bivalents at diakinesis. The oocytes were fertilized by sperm from the free-living males, and a fertilization
                  membrane was formed. The oocyte nucleus migrated to the plasma membrane, apparently preparing for its first reductional division,
                  with homolog pairing. But at metaphase, the bivalents separated and formed an equatorial plate with 6 chromosomes. The unique
                  maturation division splitted the 6 chromosomes, and a polar body was extruded. Thus the maturation division started like a
                  reductional division but ended in an equational division. During this time, the sperm was condensed into a small DNA mass
                  that could later be found in one cell of the cleaved embryo. This behavior thus corresponded to a pseudogamous parthenogenetic
                  reproduction, as described above for <span class="italic">M. belari</span> (<a href="#sec5.2.3" title="5.2.3.&nbsp;Pseudogamous gonochorism with partial true fertilization: Mesorhabditis spp.">Section 5.2.3</a>). The absence of true fertilization would explain why only females were formed in the next infective generation.
               </p>
               <p>Some observations of Nigon and Roman suggested the presence of rare alternative behaviors. In one egg, they described the
                  presence of two pronuclei, each containing 3 chromosomes; no condensed sperm was found in this egg. This configuration thus
                  corresponded to a normal fertilization, with two haploid pronuclei. In the same animal, another egg displayed the most usual
                  pseudogamous behavior. Thus, as in <span class="italic">M. belari</span>, in the same individual two modes of meiosis and fertilization could co-exist. Some eggs also appeared to contain polyploid
                  nuclei, with up to 24 chromosomes. In these eggs, the sperm remains were identifiable, but no polar bodies were seen, suggesting
                  the occurrence of abnormal maturation divisions. Thus, next to the known parthenogenetic development, variant behaviors could
                  be observed in free-living females, with unclear consequences.
               </p>
               <p>In free-living males, spermatogenesis occurred with many irregularities. A detailed study was not undertaken. Observations
                  of the development of the eggs showed that in most cases, the male genome did not participate to reproduction. However, in
                  some cases, at an unknown frequency, amphimixis could be observed, which sugested the existence of a spermatozoon with 3 chromosomes.
               </p>
               <p>In conclusion, the free-living gonochoristic generation from the strain under study in uniform culture conditions reproduced
                  mostly via pseudogamous parthenogenetic reproduction, more rarely through amphimictic reproduction, as in <span class="italic">M. belari</span>. The development of amphimictic eggs has not been studied.

               <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
               <p>More recently, alternative lifecycles of <span class="italic">Rhabdias bufonis</span> have been studied by <a href="#bib284">Spieler and Schierenberg (1995)</a>. They showed that while at hatching, larvae of both free-living and parasitic generations display a similar number of nuclei,
                  the parasitic adult (of larger size) contains many more nuclei than the free-living generation. This is in part due to the
                  presence of over 2000 nuclei in the intestine, versus about 20 in the free-living generation as in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>.
               </p>
               <p>Concerning <span class="italic">Strongyloides ratti</span>, excellent recent reviews are those of <a href="#bib294">Streit (2008)</a> and Viney and Lok (<a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_genomesStrongyloides.2/strongyloides.2.html" target="_blank">The biology of <span class="italic">Strongyloides spp</span></a>). Viney studied many strains of <span class="italic">S. ratti</span>, with a well-controlled culture technique, and found that coproculture gave rise to a high proportion of free-living females.
                  Development in free-living adults versus infective larvae was governed by many factors including the strain, the culture conditions
                  and the immunological status of the host rat (<a href="#bib321">Viney et al., 1992</a>; <a href="#bib318">Viney, 1996</a>; <a href="#bib124">Harvey et al., 2000</a>).
               </p>
               <p>The reproduction mode of the free-living generation of <span class="italic">S. ratti</span> remains controversial and it is possible that the character varies among closely related species (<a href="#bib294">Streit, 2008</a>). Through studies of the segregation of molecular genetic markers, Viney et al. confirmed that the parasitic generation of
                  <span class="italic">S. ratti</span> reproduced parthenogenetically (<a href="#bib319">Viney, 1994</a>) and that males carried a single copy of one chromosome, consistent with XX/X0 sex determination (<a href="#bib125">Harvey and Viney, 2001</a>). However, in contrast to the cytological studies by <a href="#bib227">Nigon and Roman (1952)</a>, they found, using genetic markers, that the free-living adults reproduced through true fertilization (amphimixis) (<a href="#bib322">Viney et al., 1993</a>; <a href="#bib207">Nemetschke et al., 2010b</a>). The discrepancy between the cytological studies and the later genetic studies remains unexplained (<a href="#bib294">Streit, 2008</a>). The occurrence of pseudogamy versus amphimixis, or their relative frequency if they coexist, may depend on external factors
                  as well as on the genetic composition of different <span class="italic">S. ratti</span> lines (or cryptic <span class="italic">Strongyloides</span> species). Studying the cytology of meiosis and fertilization on lines where amphimixis seems prevalent appears useful at
                  this point. Ongoing research indicates an exciting future for studies on this species and closely related species (<a href="#bib206">Nemetschke et al., 2010a</a>).
               </p>
               <p>A new convenient model system to study the alternation of generations with different modes of reproduction is now available,
                  without an obligate parasitic stage. The species provisionally called <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> sp. SB347 develops on agar plates seeded with <span class="italic">E. coli,</span> either through a generation that adopts the dauer stage and develops into hermaphroditic adults, or through a gonochoristic
                  generation that does not pass through the dauer stage (<a href="#bib101">F&eacute;lix, 2004</a>). The ecology of the species is unknown but it is possible that the dauer stage corresponds to passage in a host. Morph and
                  sex determination in this species are being studied in the laboratory of Andre Pires daSilva (<a href="#bib60">Chaudhuri et al., 2011</a>). The paucity of males in the progeny of the gonochoristic generation has been explained by the asymmetry of spermatocyte
                  division and the selection of the X-bearing sperm spermatocyte, vindicating the hypothesis of Boveri and Schleip for <span class="italic">R. bufonis</span> (<a href="#bib275">Shakes et al., 2011</a>).

               <p>Dougherty and Hermione G. Calhoun were the first to suggest the potential relevance of species of the rhabditids for studies
                  in formal genetics (<a href="#bib83">Dougherty and Calhoun, 1948a</a>). Dougherty foresaw the advantages that the reproductive modes (<a href="#bib78">Dougherty, 1949</a>) and the developmental speed could bring to genetic studies. The selfing mode of reproduction appeared particularly convenient
                  to produce homozygous mutant animals. Dougherty hoped that the possibility of culture on defined media could lead to studies
                  in physiological genetics inspired by those of Beadle and Tatum on <span class="italic">Neurospora</span>.

               <p>While the first genetic variant in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> was the tetraploid line (<a href="#bib214">Nigon, 1949b</a>; <a href="#bib215">Nigon, 1951a</a>) (see <a href="#sec4.2" title="4.2.&nbsp;Chromosomal sex determination in hermaphroditic species">Section 4.4</a>), the first description and analysis of a recessive mutation was in <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> (<a href="#bib224">Nigon and Dougherty, 1950</a>). This mutation appeared in a culture that had been exposed to a temperature higher than 23&deg;C. In the adult stage, this mutant
                  was approximately a quarter shorter than the wild-type, hence its designation as <span class="italic">micro</span>. Its width was identical to that of the wild type, giving it a stocky appearance (<a href="#figure16">Figure 16</a>). Its fecundity and motility were reduced.

               <p>Crosses of <span class="italic">micro</span> hermaphrodites with wild-type males gave rise to heterozygote progeny of wild-type phenotype, both males and hermaphrodites.
                  When the F1 hermaphrodites were selfed, the F2 generation showed a segregation of wild-type and mutant phenotypes. The F3
                  progeny from F2 individuals of wild-type phenotype were further followed (<a href="#figure16">Figure 16</a>C). The values for the F2 genotypes were close to the 1:2:1 ratio expected for the F2 progeny of a F1 hybrid between wild-type
                  and homozygous recessive mutant parents. In addition, F1 males backcrossed to <span class="italic">micro</span> hermaphrodites yielded hermaphrodites and males, both of wild-type and mutant phenotypes (<a href="#figure16">Figure 16</a>D). The F1 males were thus heterozygous, showing that the mutation is not sex-linked. It was concluded that the micro character
                  depended on an autosomal recessive mutation.
               </p>
               <p>Several attempts were made by Dougherty and Nigon to study the effect of chemical mutagens. The first experiments, performed
                  in Paris in 1949, made use of yperite and acriflavine (<a href="#bib225">Nigon and Dougherty, 1953</a>; <a href="#bib87">Dougherty and Nigon, 1953</a>). <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> did not provide a variety of obvious mutant phenotypes. Treatment with yperite resulted in a <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> strain with variable phenotypes, named &#8220;pygmy", which differed from the micro mutants (<a href="#bib225">Nigon and Dougherty, 1953</a>). These animals grew with a variable rate, ranging from normal speed to very <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000031;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">slow growth</a>. For those reaching the adult stage, their shape and size were close to those of normal individuals of this species, and
                  some died before reaching the adult stage. This form was maintained for hundreds of generations by selfing, without modification
                  of the phenotypic variability. Nigon pursued studies on the variable expression of the phenotype, trying to select phenotypic
                  extremes in the pure line (<a href="#bib218">Nigon, 1954</a>).
               </p>
               <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
               <p>The spontaneous <span class="italic">micro</span> mutant in <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> corresponds to a common class of mutants found in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> and other rhabditids, now called <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">dumpy</a></span> (abbreviated <span class="italic">dpy</span>) following <a href="#bib41">Brenner (1974)</a>. The slow-growing <span class="italic">pygmy</span> mutant with variable expression (<a href="#bib225">Nigon and Dougherty, 1953</a>) was likely what is now called <span class="italic">gro</span> (abnormal GROwth rate) or <span class="italic">clk</span> (CLocK, biological timing abnormality) mutants, which display reduced growth rates. Nigon was interested by the variability
                  of its phenotype, which may have reflected the variable expressivity of such mutants.
               </p>
               <p>Together with the tetraploids, these mutants marked the beginning of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> and <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> genetics. Reasons why Nigon and Dougherty did not carry on with mutageneses are discussed in <a href="#sec12.1.1" title="12.1.1.&nbsp;The pioneers in Caenorhabditis genetics">Section 12.1.1</a>.

               <p>The sensitivity of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> (and other species) to high temperature was noted by <a href="#bib186">Maupas (1900)</a>. In Bergerac, Nigon collected <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> twice (<a href="#sec17" title="17.&nbsp;Appendix 2. The C. elegans Bergerac strain.">Appendix 2</a>, <a href="#sec17" title="17.&nbsp;Appendix 2. The C. elegans Bergerac strain.">Section 17</a>). The first strain, sampled in 1941, could multiply well at 25 &deg;C. The second strain (known today as Bergerac) isolated in
                  March 1944, displayed abnormalities already at the temperatures of 23-24 &deg;C (<a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>). Only this second strain was studied by morphologists (Dougherty, Osche, etc.) and confirmed by them as <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>. It is possible that the first isolate might have been another species, such as <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span>, or a <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> with normal resistance to temperatures of 23-25 &deg;C.
               </p>
               <p>The <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> strain from Bristol is indeed still fertile at 25&deg;C. The transmission of the genetic difference in heat tolerance between
                  the 1944 Bergerac and the Bristol strains of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> was studied by Helene Fatt and E. Dougherty (<a href="#bib100">Fatt and Dougherty, 1963</a>). At that time, crosses between the Bergerac and Bristol strains could not be made in the axenic liquid media used in the
                  Dougherty lab, so they used agar plates seeded with <span class="italic">E. coli</span> for the crosses and, after antibiotic treatment, brought them back to axenic liquid culture. The heat tolerance of Bristol
                  was found to be dominant and to segregate in an approximate 3:1 ratio. Analysis of individual heat-tolerant F2s yielded a
                  ratio of 1 homozygous to 1.5 heterozygous, not too distant from the expected 1:2. Following a first cross of Bergerac hermaphrodites
                  with Bristol males and a backcross of F1 males to Bergerac, some F2 progeny were heat-tolerant&#8211;thus the transmission was not
                  X-linked but autosomal. In conclusion, heat sensitivity of Bergerac vs. Bristol was transmitted as a recessive autosomal trait.
                  This is the first example of genetic analysis of a natural variation in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>.
               </p>
               <p>This genetic study was followed by an attempt by Fatt to characterize factors of the culture medium that participated in inhibiting
                  progeny production of the Bergerac strain at high temperature. These environmental manipulations were performed by changing
                  the composition of the axenic medium. Fatt found that at high temperature Bergerac individuals produced an inhibitory substance,
                  whereas Bristol did not (Fatt, 1967).

               <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
               <p>The major autosomal locus responsible for the difference in heat tolerance between the Bergerac and Bristol strains of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> has been mapped to chromosome II and the locus called <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006997;class=Gene" target="_blank">zyg-12</a></span> by <a href="#bib328">Wood et al. (1980)</a>; it was mapped again by <a href="#bib278">Shook et al. (1996)</a>. The gene and molecular lesion were identified by <a href="#bib183">Malone et al. (2003)</a>. The Bergerac allele is a thermosensitive reduction-of-function missense mutation (<span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00054637;class=Variation" target="_blank">ct350</a></span>, an A to C change) in the <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006997;class=Gene" target="_blank">zyg-12</a></span> gene. This gene encodes a transmembrane protein of the conserved Hook family that links the centrosome to the nucleus (<a href="#bib261">Sato et al., 2009</a>), and through the nuclear envelope also participates in chromosome pairing in early meiosis as well as in the overall architecture
                  of this part of the gonad (<a href="#bib242">Penkner et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#bib243">Penkner et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib334">Zhou et al., 2009</a>). The temperature-sensitivity of the Bergerac allele appears to originate in the binding inability of the Bergerac <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE32088;class=Protein" target="_blank">ZYG-12</a> protein at high temperature (<a href="#bib183">Malone et al., 2003</a>).
               </p>
               <p>The presence of this temperature-sensitive <span class="italic">zyg-12(<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00054637;class=Variation" target="_blank">ct350</a>)</span> allele in the <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> Bergerac explains several temperature-dependent phenotypes that were observed by Nigon and colleagues, such as unpaired chromosomes
                  in early meiosis and polyploid nuclei in the gonad (<a href="#bib216">Nigon, 1951b</a>; <a href="#bib48">Brun, 1955</a>), centrosomes detaching from the male pronucleus after fertilization, and the two pronuclei staying apart resulting in embryonic
                  cleavage defects (<a href="#bib226">Nigon et al., 1960</a>). Note that independent of the <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006997;class=Gene" target="_blank">zyg-12</a></span> mutation, chromosome pairing in meiosis is also temperature-sensitive in the Bristol/<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a> background, which may explain the increased male production at high temperature (<a href="#bib29">Bilgir et al., 2013</a>). Thus, although the specific <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006997;class=Gene" target="_blank">zyg-12</a></span> mutation makes some cellular reactions particularly sensitive to high temperature for Bergerac animals, other processes are
                  similarly temperature-sensitive in the different wild strains of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>.

               <p>Jean-Louis Brun was a student of Nigon in Lyon (see <a href="#sec18" title="18.&nbsp;Appendix 3. Biographies">Appendix 3</a>, <a href="#sec18.2" title="18.2.&nbsp;Paula Hertwig (1889-1983)">Section 18.6</a>). Brun started classical genetic experiments with <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, after performing the high temperature experiments described in <a href="#sec10" title="10.&nbsp;Adaptation to high temperature">Section 10</a>, at a time when Nigon himself had left the worm and gave Brun the chance to conduct his own research. With Michel Dion, Brun
                  first isolated and analyzed two spontaneous dwarf (<span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">dumpy</a></span>) mutations in the <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> Bergerac background (<a href="#bib76">Dion and Brun, 1971</a>). These mutations were found to be recessive, autosomal and unlinked. One of them is available at the CGC as <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=FF1;class=Strain" target="_blank">FF1</a>, of genotype <span class="italic">dpy-5(<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00145300;class=Variation" target="_blank">f1</a>)</span> (M. Whistler, D. Riddle, P. Swanson, personal communication, <a href="http://wbg.wormbook.org/wli/wbg7.1p50/" target="_blank">The Worm Breeder's Gazette, 7 (1): 50</a>). Cadet and Dion, informed by Brenner (personal communication in <a href="#bib76">Dion and Brun, 1971</a>), then reported on the use of ethyl-methane sulfonate (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=EMS;class=Cell" target="_blank">EMS</a>) as a mutagen. After mutagenesis they isolated seven other dwarf mutants, as well as one mutant with a defect in locomotion
                  (<a href="#bib58">Cadet and Dion, 1973</a>). X-ray mutagenesis was also used (<a href="#bib236">Ouazana and Brun, 1975</a>).

               <p>Complementation and linkage studies were performed (<a href="#bib76">Dion and Brun, 1971</a>) (<a href="#figure17">Figure 17</a>).

               <p>We will be brief on this part that came after the first publication on <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> by Brenner in 1974. After this, the Brun team published on a variety of mutant phenotypes, such as a high incidence of males
                  (called <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0001175;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">Him</a>) (<a href="#bib21">B&eacute;guet, 1978</a>), a transformation of the hermaphrodite tail towards a male tail (<a href="#bib23">B&eacute;guet and Gibert, 1978</a>) (identified as a weak <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006605;class=Gene" target="_blank">tra-2</a></span> allele by <a href="#bib135">Hodgkin (1985)</a>), temperature-sensitive lethality and sterility (<a href="#bib1">Abdulkader and Brun, 1976</a>; <a href="#bib2">Abdulkader and Brun, 1978</a>, <a href="#bib3">1980</a>; <a href="#bib3">Abdulkader et al., 1980</a>), as well as unconditional sterility (<a href="#bib201">Mounier and Brun, 1980</a>; <a href="#bib108">Gibert et al., 1984</a>). Brun passed away in 1981, but the team continued until the end of ongoing PhD theses. Overall, one focus was the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">dumpy</a> mutants (<a href="#bib235">Ouazana and Brun, 1978</a>; <a href="#bib234">Ouazana, 1978</a>) and collagen structure (<a href="#bib238">Ouazana and Gibert, 1979</a>; <a href="#bib239">Ouazana and Herbage, 1981</a>; <a href="#bib237">Ouazana et al., 1985</a>), because many <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">dumpy</a></span> mutations affect collagen genes. The second focus was gametogenesis and the sterile mutants, because of the central importance
                  of gametogenesis in reproduction (<a href="#bib5">Abi-Rached and Brun, 1975</a>; <a href="#bib6">Abirached and Brun, 1978</a>; <a href="#bib7">Abirached and Brun, 1979</a>; <a href="#bib286">Starck et al., 1983</a>; <a href="#bib285">Starck, 1984</a>). The sterile mutants were, however, more difficult to maintain and study than the classes first chosen in the Brenner lab,
                  such as <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000643;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">uncoordinated</a> mutants or cell lineage mutants with egg-laying defects.
               </p>
               <p>Other than the <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006605;class=Gene" target="_blank">tra-2</a></span> allele that was crossed into the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a> background (<a href="#bib135">Hodgkin, 1985</a>), these later mutants, all in the Bergerac background, do not seem to have been preserved.
               </p>
               <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
               <p>Genetic complementation and linkage were developed in the team of Brun. Although Dougherty and Brun agreed that they needed
                  to develop genetics, their attempts were dwarfed by the extent (number of mutants and genetic map), the phenotypic diversity,
                  and the biological relevance of the first mutageneses performed by Brenner et al. The Brun team later started isolating a
                  variety of mutant phenotypes, possibly following contact with the budding <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> community (particularly David Hirsh). A strength of Brenner's work was to find many locomotion-defective (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/search/phenotype/unc" target="_blank">&#8220;uncoordinated&#8221;</a>) mutants that allowed him, crossing them with the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">dumpy</a> mutants, to build a genetic map (<a href="#bib41">Brenner, 1974</a>). Using dwarf mutants alone, linkage analysis was more arduous (<a href="#bib76">Dion and Brun, 1971</a>). This is an example of the awkwardness in the use of genetics by the French team, which was isolated in Lyon from geneticists
                  in France and elsewhere.
               </p>
               <p>Another problematic issue was the divergent use of the Bergerac and Bristol strains. While the rest of the world adopted Bristol,
                  which developed better at temperatures above 20&deg;C, the team in Lyon had naturally carried on with mutagenesis of the Bergerac
                  strain. This may have contributed to their mutants having been little used and forgotten.

            <p>In 1966, Jean-Louis Brun published a series of three papers reporting on the dynamics and reversibility of laboratory adaptation
               of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> Bergerac to a higher temperature (<a href="#bib50">Brun, 1966a</a>, <a href="#bib51">b</a>, <a href="#bib52">c</a>). These papers corresponded to his thesis under the supervision of Nigon in Lyon. The adaptation experiment was also briefly
               summarized in English in <span class="italic">Science</span> (<a href="#bib49">Brun, 1965</a>). The results of these papers remained mostly unknown, yet their significance may be re-evaluated in the light of recent
               results on epigenetic inheritance in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>.

               <p>In an experiment running over thousand generations and several years, Brun progressively adapted the Bergerac line to higher
                  temperatures, using the following protocol. At each generation, 6-10 young adult progeny from the same parent were isolated
                  (each in a separate culture), in the high temperature lines (cultured at temperatures ranging from 22-24.5 &deg;C) and in an 18
                  &deg;C control line. Selection was applied in the sense that: 1) the chosen brood was that with the most abundant progeny at this
                  (early) time, and without aberrant-looking individuals; and 2) the individuals were chosen among the first descendants, so
                  as to avoid crossing with males.
               </p>
               <p>Brun first defined four types of behavior of the Bergerac line when brought to a range of high temperatures (<a href="#bib50">Brun, 1966a</a>) (<a href="#figure18">Figure 18</a>). The Bergerac line was routinely kept at 18 &deg;C, without signs of sterility. Above 24 &deg;C, the strain was immediately sterile.
                  At 23 or 23.5 &deg;C, the strain only became sterile after several generations, with a progressive decrease in brood size. This
                  multigenerational phenotype resembles that now called Mortal germ line (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000966;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">Mrt</a>) (<a href="#bib8">Ahmed and Hodgkin, 2000</a>). At 22&deg;C, the strain remained fertile, and after 100 generations, was able to sustain 23 &deg;C without a <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000966;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">Mrt</a> phenotype: the line had thus adapted to a higher temperature regime.

               <p>Brun then continued using this method of acclimatization, from 22 &deg;C to 23 &deg;C, then using 0.5 &deg;C steps of 100-450 generations
                  each, until, after over 1000 generations, the culture could be maintained at 24.5 &deg;C, a temperature at which it was initially
                  sterile. This acclimatization was reproducible when parallel lines were followed, with a similar timecourse: a first rapid
                  decrease in brood size when the strain was shifted to the higher temperature (over 2-10 generations&#8211;potentially leading to
                  a <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000966;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">Mrt</a> phenotype), a phase of rapid recovery (over ~100 generations), followed by a late phase with a slower increase in brood size
                  (up to 500 generations). During this last phase, the line became finally able to withstand the next 0.5 &deg;C increase.

               <p>When brought back to 18 &deg;C, high-temperature adapted lines showed a higher brood size than the control 18 &deg;C line for several
                  generations. The effect was cumulative: brood size upon return to 18 &deg;C increased as a function of the adaptation temperature
                  and the duration of culture at this temperature. This effect of long exposure to high temperature was reversible and brood
                  size then gradually decreased over 10-100 generations of return to 18 &deg;C.
               </p>
               <p>Upshifting the temperature again after a few generations at 18 &deg;C, Brun further showed that the adaptation to high temperature
                  was rapidly lost after as few as 7-10 generations at 18 &deg;C (<a href="#figure19">Figure 19</a>). He repeated these observations with several lines and several adaptation and reversion temperatures in a reproducible and
                  apparently progressive fashion (<a href="#bib51">Brun, 1966b</a>). Thus, adaptation to high temperatures was slow&#8211;over hundreds of generations&#8211;but reversible over a few generations of selfing
                  at 18 &deg;C.

                  of sufficient initial genetic variation that could be selected upon was also ruled out by the selfing nature of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> and the maintenance regime with a single individual prior to the experiment. Third, de novo mutations surely occurred over
                  hundreds of generations and could have been selected for; some temperature steps may possibly have been achieved by such incoming
                  genetic variation. Yet Brun disfavored the role of genetic evolution by mutation in his experiment for several reasons: 1)
                  the overall continuous adaptation over the five temperature steps, 2) the reproducibility of the adaptation schedule in different
                  lines and at different temperatures, and 3) the rapidity and reproducibility of the reversion in adaptation upon return at
                  a lower temperature.
               </p>
               <p>Having ruled out that the above factors were sufficient to explain the adaptation dynamics in his selfing lines, Brun proposed
                  that the observed heritable adaptation to high temperature occurred through non-genetic changes (&#8220;genetic&#8221; or &#8220;genic&#8221; is here
                  used to mean based on DNA sequence, whereas &#8220;heritable&#8221; refers to transmission between generations, which is not necessarily
                  DNA-sequence based, e.g., through small RNAs and histone modifications). Brun envisioned on one hand heritable non-genic sterilizing
                  processes (called S) that would decrease fertility across generations, and on the other hand a slower acclimatization process
                  (called A) that would slow down the fertility decline. He hypothesized that the acclimatization could work either through variation and selection on
                  the heritable sterilizing processes and/or of a physiological regulation induced by the environment that would inhibit these
                  processes or their heritability. If the modifications were originally induced by the environment, they then became heritable
                  and partially independent of it. The <span class="italic">Science</span> article ended with: &#8220;Comprehensive observations support the assumption that adaptive transmissible cytoplasmic states are
                  produced gradually and are responsible for the production of fertile high-temperature strains&#8221; (<a href="#bib49">Brun, 1965</a>).
               </p>
               <p>The Brun 1966 articles were further summarized in <a href="#bib222">Nigon and Brun (1967)</a>, yet hardly cited outside of Brun's group. They inserted themselves well in the contemporary scientific context of some adaptive
                  heredity literature (<a href="#bib165">Lansing, 1954</a>; <a href="#bib152">Jinks, 1964</a>), and were indeed cited on this behalf (<a href="#bib70">Davitashvili, 1969</a>) and more recently (<a href="#bib241">Pal and Miklos, 1999</a>; <a href="#bib306">Tal et al., 2010</a>). Yet they remained unexplained in terms of possible mechanisms and did not fit well with the increased use of standard genetics
                  in both laboratory and evolutionary biology at that time.

               <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
               <p>Almost fifty years later, the progressive Mortal germ line (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000966;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">Mrt</a>) phenotype observed by Brun in the Bergerac strain needs yet to be reproduced and explained. This phenotype has not been
                  detected in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a>, but has been observed in many temperature-sensitive mutants derived from it, affecting : 1) telomere formation and DNA repair
                  (<a href="#bib281">Smelick and Ahmed, 2005</a>; <a href="#bib160">Kirienko et al., 2010</a>), or 2) histone modifications and small RNA synthesis in the germ line (<a href="#bib54">Buckley et al., 2012</a>; Simon et al., 2014). Because germ line small RNAs and histone modifications are transmissible across generations in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> (<a href="#bib119">Grishok et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib57">Burton et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib120">Gu et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib54">Buckley et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib15">Ashe et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib277">Shirayama et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib63">Conine et al., 2013</a>), they could perhaps explain a non-genic transgenerational effect or adaptation.
               </p>
               <p>A feature that is now known to differ between the Bristol (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a>) and at least some Bergerac-derived strains is the level of germ line transposition&#8211;much higher in the latter&#8211;although it
                  greatly varies among derivatives of the Bergerac strain (<a href="#bib95">Emmons et al., 1983</a>; <a href="#bib169">Liao et al., 1983</a>; <a href="#bib198">Moerman and Waterston, 1984</a>) (see <a href="#sec17" title="17.&nbsp;Appendix 2. The C. elegans Bergerac strain.">Appendix 2</a>, <a href="#sec17" title="17.&nbsp;Appendix 2. The C. elegans Bergerac strain.">Section 17</a>). Interestingly, some of the mutants with a <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000966;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">Mrt</a> phenotype in the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a> background also have an increased transposition rate, through the lack of matching small RNAs (<a href="#bib69">Das et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib16">Bagijn et al., 2012</a>). It is so far unclear whether the high level of transposition in both Bergerac and these mutants is a/the process leading
                  to sterility after several generations. Other processes, such as progressive deregulation in gene expression, have also been
                  proposed in the case of germ line small RNA pathway mutants (<a href="#bib54">Buckley et al., 2012</a>).
               </p>
               <p>A few years after Brun's experiments, Hansen, Lower, Yarwood et al., past collaborators of Dougherty (<a href="#bib173">Lower, 1966</a>), adapted large populations of <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> and <span class="italic">P. redivivus</span> (<a href="#bib174">Lower et al., 1968</a>; <a href="#bib175">Lower et al., 1970</a>) to high temperatures, with an interesting axenic culture design resembling <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> population cages (<a href="#bib122">Hansen and Cryan, 1966</a>). In this work, adaptation was presumed to be genetic and Brun's work was not cited. The authors did not test for the stability
                  of the adaptation.

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>Brun later studied with Danielle Lebre and Bernard B&eacute;guet the effect of parental age on the brood size of the first and subsequent
               generations. Using the Bergerac strain, they uncovered an effect of mother's age on the F1 brood size at 18 &deg;C, through both
               a decrease in sperm number and an increase in embryonic lethality (<a href="#bib53">Brun and Lebre, 1968</a>; <a href="#bib22">B&eacute;guet and Brun, 1972</a>). In a design similar to that of <a href="#bib165">Lansing</a> (1954) in a rotifer, B&eacute;guet then continued with what he called the Y (Young) and O (Old) series, derived at each generation
               from young or older mothers, respectively. The effect of age was reversible in one generation after return to the Y series
               (<a href="#bib20">B&eacute;guet, 1972</a>). The O series gradually adapted to its treatment by returning to a brood size equivalent to both the starting level and
               the parallel Y series, within five generations.
            </p>
            <p><span class="italic">In today's light</span></p>
            <p>It is possible that the effect of age is related mechanistically to the multigenerational <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000966;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">Mrt</a> phenotype. At the least, it suggests that Brun's choice to pick the first progeny during his temperature adaptation may have
               driven some adaptive phenotypic effect.
            </p>
            <p>Experiments on the effect of aging on next-generation brood size have not been performed more recently to our knowledge. More
               generally, little attention has been paid to the effect of parental age. <a href="#bib213">Nigon (1949a)</a> had first shown in <span class="italic">M. belari</span> an effect of parental age on the proportion of eggs developing through pseudogamy versus true fertilization. A lack of parental
               effect was observed on the longevity of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> progeny (in contrast to rotifers and other animals) (<a href="#bib160a">Klass, 1977</a>). In recent studies with <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, the effect of parental age has been paid little attention to, or only to control for it and prevent its interference. Parental
               age was however observed to decrease recombination frequency at meiosis (<a href="#bib258">Rose and Baillie, 1979</a>; <a href="#bib170">Lim et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib115">Goldstein and Curis, 1987</a>). More recently, oocyte quality was shown to decrease with age through regulation by the TGF&#946; and insulin pathways (<a href="#bib180">Luo et al., 2010</a>). Parental age also has a dramatic effect on progeny survival in a cross between <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> wild isolates displaying incompatibilities at the <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00021463;class=Gene" target="_blank">zeel-1</a>/<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00077563;class=Gene" target="_blank">peel-1</a></span> locus, with the older progeny surviving better. This effect was hypothesized to depend on sperm size (<a href="#bib274">Seidel et al., 2011</a>). The decreased (or increased in the latter case) quality of late progeny is likely to have important consequences on population
               dynamics.

            <p>Historical accounts of the development of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> as a model organism usually neglect early studies that used <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> (<a href="#figure20">Figure 20</a>) and other free-living nematodes as model organisms to address general questions in biology; they start with Brenner (<a href="#bib71">de Chadarevian, 1998</a>), or only cite Maupas for the species description and Dougherty for sending the Bristol strain to Brenner (<a href="#bib13">Ankeny, 2001</a>; <a href="#bib47">Brown, 2003</a>). Brenner undoubtedly had a pivotal importance in the history of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, made it a key model organism, and achieved much with it that his predecessors had failed to develop. In his 1974 paper (<a href="#bib41">Brenner, 1974</a>), he cited studies by Dougherty, Nigon, and Brun (<a href="#figure21">Figure 21</a>); the first and second &#8220;Wormbook&#8221; (<a href="#bib326">Wood, 1988</a>; <a href="#bib255">Riddle et al., 1997</a>) also cited many early publications. In later historical accounts however, the earlier work became neglected (see <a href="#bib138">Hodgkin, 2002b</a> for an exception). This neglect may be explained by several factors, including the language of publications (French mostly,
               and German for some other species), the fact that Nigon and Dougherty were no longer in the field when Brenner started, the
               focus on the brilliant figure of Brenner, the shift to a new reference strain, &#8230; and the mere passage of time and simplification
               of the historical narrative.

                  <p>After the early work of Gregor Mendel in the 19<sup>th</sup> century with plants, the scientific field of genetics arose during the first half of the 20th century in model organisms
                     such as <span class="italic">Drosophila</span>, <span class="italic">Neurospora</span>, mice, and various plants. First limited to the transmission of external characters, the first geneticists constructed abstract
                     notions of heredity and genes. Morgan and his collaborators made an advance towards physical location by building a (still
                     abstract) map of genes along <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> chromosomes. A first link between genes and phenotypes came with the works of Boris Ephrussi, Beadle, and Tatum and their
                     &#8220;one gene, one enzyme&#8221; theory, which greatly influenced Dougherty and Nigon. The physical involvement of nucleic acids in
                     genetic transmission was solved by studies of the genetics of bacteria and viruses, and of the structure, synthesis, and regulation
                     of nucleic acids and proteins in the years 1940-1960. The gene appeared then, for the first time, as a chemically and biologically
                     defined entity, the structure and activity of which could be simultaneously accessed through biochemical and genetical analyses.
                     This anchoring of the gene in the biochemical realm contrasted with the abstract notion of heredity of the Weismannian tradition.

                  <p>How could the nematode contribute to this modern biology? Was metabolism the entry point to experimental genetics, beyond
                     the genetics of morphology that was practiced until then? In French laboratories, often refractory to the older abstract concept
                     of the gene, these developments were provoking endless discussions. Opponents were scoffing at the &#8220;faith&#8221; of innocents who
                     imagined they could succeed in manipulating these molecular chains, at the resolution limit of the most powerful electron
                     microscopes. Nigon was one of these innocents, imagining that the fast multiplication and simple structure of nematodes would
                     present the same kind of advantages as those provided by bacteria. The recruitment of experimental geneticists, embryologists,
                     and biochemists to his team appeared an absolute necessity. Nigon, as a student, had first hoped to work in Paris at the Pasteur
                     Institute, but the war context had retained him far from Paris. After the war, political circumstances prevented him (a member
                     of the French Communist Party) from traveling to the United States (then in the period of McCarthy's anti-communist hunt)
                     to widen his horizons. Nigon held Ephrussi in high esteem, but Ephrussi did not encourage his <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> project: in 1947 he asked Nigon when he would stop amusing himself with his little animals (&#8220;quand aurez-vous fini de vous
                     amuser avec vos petites b&ecirc;tes?&#8221;). Andr&eacute; Lwoff was then relatively isolated, with widespread recognition in France coming only
                     after the Nobel Prize in 1965. Thus, French science politics at the time was not favorable. In California, Dougherty made
                     similar proposals on the potential of free-living nematodes, in his case extrapolating from the experiments of Beadle, but
                     also had trouble securing funding in the context of his work on a nutritional medium (<a href="#bib104">Ferris and Hieb, 2015</a>). Unfortunately, Nigon and Dougherty were not advised nor heeded. In addition, the time was perhaps too early for developing
                     an animal model organism for molecular biology, when the foundations of molecular biology were still being built.
                  </p>
                  <p>Nigon, Dougherty, and Brun however made pioneering attempts in <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis</span> genetics and were the first to discover mutations in <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> and <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>. It now appears clearly that several problems affected Nigon and Dougherty in the 1950s and prevented them from carrying
                     further genetic experiments. Their inexperience made them search for mutations affecting characters with deep biological significance.
                     And to neglect, hardly seeing them, variations that seemed to them of no interest. Their reference was the variety of <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> morphological phenotypes (color and shapes of eye, wing, etc.) and of <span class="italic">Neurospora</span> metabolic mutants. Spotting new phenotypes is not obvious, and greatly improves with self-confidence and training (<a href="#bib161">Kohler, 1994</a>; <a href="#bib43">Brenner, 1994</a>). Let us also note that behavioral genetics with the screening for such mutants in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> and in <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> was a revolution of the late 1970s, which was not immediately accepted. So, on one hand, Nigon and Dougherty paid insufficient
                     attention to various phenotypes, such as behavioral or developmental phenotypes; on the other hand, they did not conceive
                     of the idea of using several mutations with the same phenotype. Testing whether mutations with the same phenotypes affected
                     the same genetic locus with a genetic complementation test was not obvious at that time. A complex version of the complementation
                     test, the cis-trans test of Seymour Benzer in the T4 phage and Ed Lewis in <span class="italic">Drosophila</span>, was just appearing; the modern version (without the cis arrangement of the two alleles, very difficult to obtain in most
                     organisms including <span class="italic">C. elegan</span>s) only became used in the 1960s (<a href="#bib126">Hawley and Gilliland, 2006</a>). Thus, the lack of diverse phenotypes was a critical obstacle for Nigon who could not see how to go further with the genetics
                     of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, while Dougherty continued his quest for a defined medium to screen for metabolic mutants in the &#8216;one gene, one enzyme&#8217; framework.
                  </p>
                  <p>In Lyon, an important change occurred with the construction of a new laboratory, in part through the administrative supervision
                     of Nigon. The old Faculty of Sciences, dating from 1880, was abandoned, and this new building opened in October 1962, with
                     well-equipped spaces dedicated to experimental biology. This new start could have been placed under the joint authority of
                     Nigon, Dougherty and Brun, for example, and be dedicated to the study of <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span>. The question was not even raised. It is likely that at that time, the scientific paths of these three scientists were too
                     far engaged in independent routes to think of a new common start. Nigon abandoned nematodes rapidly and, after a long exploratory
                     work on various species and various transmissible characters, found a more promising way towards molecular biology in the
                     study of polysomes in <span class="italic">Euglena</span> and of human <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00014021;class=Gene" target="_blank">globin</a> mutations. Among his collaborators, only Brun persisted, with extreme courage and loneliness, in pursuing studies on <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, most of which ran against the contemporary mainstream of genetics.

                  <p>In the early 1960s, Sydney Brenner was already famous for his work in the new and exciting field of molecular biology, particularly
                     the discovery of messenger RNA and the genetic code (<a href="#bib155">Judson, 1996</a>; <a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>). In contrast to Nigon and Dougherty, Brenner had extensive experience with genetic analysis of bacteria and phages, where
                     multiple mutations in various loci were known to have similar phenotypes, at least superficially, and he followed closely
                     the phage experiments of Seymour Benzer. Like other molecular biologists, Brenner thought that the major questions had been
                     solved in molecular biology by the early 1960s and he was searching for an adequate model animal to start a new research program
                     in developmental biology and neurobiology. At that time, for similar reasons, Seymour Benzer turned to <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> behavior, Gunther Stent to the planarian, Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob to the mouse, etc. Brenner first experimented with a variety of
                     small animals, including rotifers, and got particularly interested in nematodes. One aspect that strongly attracted him to
                     the nematodes was the known invariance of their cellular composition&#8211;including neuronal connections for which he cited Goldschmidt&#8211;and
                     their small size, allowing them to fit entirely in the electron microscope. Having an intermediate phenotypic level between
                     genetic loci and behavior at the level of neurons and neuronal connections appeared to him as the way forward in neurobiology
                     (<a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>).
                  </p>
                  <p>Was Brenner much influenced by prior studies and scientists in its choice and use of <span class="italic">C. elegan</span>s? Brenner asked Dougherty for the <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> Bristol culture in the fall of 1963, perhaps after seeing the article of <a href="#bib100">Fatt and Dougherty (1963)</a>. His letter acknowledging receipt enthusiastically stated: &#8220;It is an astounding organism&#8221; (<a href="#bib82">Dougherty, 1963</a>). He then met Dougherty in Berkeley in 1965, while Brenner was on sabbatical (<a href="#bib287">Stent, 1965</a>; <a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>). Brenner however continued to experiment with many nematode species, and isolated and gathered many new strains. Besides
                     the ease of culture and the facility for genetics, one key criterion that Brenner looked for was a good fixation for electron
                     microscopy, so as to be able to reconstruct all neuronal connections. The first attempt at fixation of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> was disastrous, due to the fact that the culture had already <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000547;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">starved</a> and entered the dauer stage, which does not fix well (<a href="#bib92">Emmons, 2015</a>; J. Hodgkin, personal communication). Therefore, despite the fact that <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> was easy and fast to grow and had the right reproductive mode, it was not Brenner's favorite at first. However, after a later
                     successful attempt at electron microscopy on non-dauer animals, Brenner finally settled on <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> in 1967, producing his first mutant at the end of the year (<a href="#bib40">Brenner, 1966/1981</a>; <a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>; Brenner, 2009). Among free-living nematode species, <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> was the favorite species of both Maupas and Nigon, and among the species they studied, is indeed one of the fastest growing
                     at the individual and population levels, and most transparent for microscopic observations. That Brenner converged on the
                     same species, in great part independently after intensive searches and tests with his technicians Muriel Wigby and Nichol
                     Thomson (<a href="#bib40">Brenner, 1966/1981</a>; <a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>), is not particularly surprising. Besides the choice of the species, Brenner corresponded with Dougherty, then Nigon, who
                     sent him strains and techniques, for example for crosses (<a href="#bib82">Dougherty, 1963</a>; <a href="#bib220">Nigon, 1966/1970</a>). But altogether, Brenner's choice of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> was made after a thorough examination of the properties of many other free-living nematode species (identified as <span class="italic">Rhabditella</span>, <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span>, <span class="italic">Pellioditis</span>, <span class="italic">Pelodera</span>, <span class="italic">Mesorhabditis</span>, <span class="italic">Panagrolaimus</span>, <span class="italic">Panagrellus</span>, <span class="italic">Rhabditophanes</span>, <span class="italic">Acrobeloides,</span> and <span class="italic">Mesodiplogaster/Pristionchus</span>) (<a href="#bib40">Brenner, 1966/1981</a>; <a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>).
                  </p>
                  <p>Other molecular biologists became interested in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, inspired by Brenner. One who successfully continued was Gunter von Ehrenstein in G&ouml;ttingen, Germany who contributed to the
                     early cell lineage and developmental biology (<a href="#bib75">Deppe et al., 1978</a>; <a href="#bib264">Schierenberg et al., 1980</a>; <a href="#bib196">Miwa et al., 1980</a>; <a href="#bib167">Laufer and von Ehrenstein, 1981</a>; <a href="#bib59">Cassada et al., 1981</a>; <a href="#bib147">Isnenghi et al., 1983</a>). Two others started but did not pursue: Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob at the Institut Pasteur in Paris (<a href="#bib148">Jacob, 1969</a>; <a href="#bib149">Jacob, 1970</a>; <a href="#bib71">de Chadarevian, 1998</a>) and Marshall Nirenberg at the NIH (<a href="#bib228">Nirenberg and Tabery, 2001</a>). Besides being famous for his studies of lysogeny and the lactose operon, Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob was a close colleague of Sydney
                     Brenner, with whom he had performed the famous experiment demonstrating the synthesis of messenger RNAs (<a href="#bib155">Judson, 1996</a>; <a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>). By the mid-1960s (the Nobel Prize was awarded to him in 1965), Jacob was looking for an animal model organism to study
                     development. Influenced by Brenner, who sent him a culture (<a href="#bib150">Jacob, 1997</a>), he started work on <span class="italic">C. elegans,</span> and contacted Nigon about it. He successfully produced mutants of different types (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">dumpy</a>, <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000643;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">uncoordinated</a>, <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000645;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">roller</a>, molt-defective, and deformed-head mutants) (<a href="#bib148">Jacob, 1969</a>; <a href="#bib149">Jacob, 1970</a>). The reasons Jacob gave for stopping his work on <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> were of two kinds. First, <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> was difficult to manipulate for embryological studies as it exploded upon introduction of a needle and the egg shell prevented
                     the penetration of chemicals (<a href="#bib149">Jacob, 1970</a>). <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> classical embryological studies are indeed difficult but not impossible (<a href="#bib219">Nigon, 1965</a>; <a href="#bib166">Laufer et al., 1980</a>; <a href="#bib167">Laufer and von Ehrenstein, 1981</a>; <a href="#bib250">Priess and Thomson, 1987</a>; <a href="#bib327">Wood, 1991</a>; <a href="#bib112">Goldstein, 1992</a>); and injection into the germ line is now routinely performed for transgenesis (<a href="#bib190">Mello and Fire, 1995</a>). Second, in line with the aims of the Pasteur Institute, Jacob preferred to work on an organism closer to humans, and was
                     also interested in studying cancer (<a href="#bib150">Jacob, 1997</a>). He thus turned to the mouse and cultured cell lines. It also appears that the (friendly) competition with Brenner was a
                     factor in avoiding <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>.
                  </p>
                  <p>The other famous molecular biologist to turn only briefly to <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> following Brenner was Marshall Nirenberg, a competitor of Brenner on deciphering the genetic code. Nirenberg also wanted
                     to study neurobiology. A former student of Dougherty, Ruth Pertel came to his lab and produced locomotion and nervous system
                     mutants of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>. However, also fearing the competition with Brenner, he preferred to focus on his second line of research, neuroblastoma
                     (<a href="#bib228">Nirenberg and Tabery, 2001</a>).
                  </p>
                  <p>Brenner was working at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, financed by the MRC, an exceptional place in terms
                     of scientific level, funding, and freedom, where for many years he shared an office with Francis Crick. Postdocs came to study
                     transfer RNAs, but often, convinced by Brenner's enthusiasm, ended up switching to the nematode (<a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>). This contrasted with the difficulties and resistance that both Nigon and Dougherty experienced to secure funding on their
                     nematode projects. A key strength of Brenner was to be able to attract with his vision and aura both continued funding (despite
                     low initial productivity in terms of papers) and a group of impressive individuals.
                  </p>
                  <p>The first experimental paper of Brenner on <span class="italic">C. elegans,</span> published in 1974 (<a href="#bib41">Brenner, 1974</a>), is the genetic map, built from 300 mutants defining about 100 genes. The main classes were <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">dumpy</a> and <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000643;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">uncoordinated</a> mutants, as well as few other types, such as <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/species/all/phenotype/WBPhenotype:0000645#0--10" target="_blank">rollers</a>, long, <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000025;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">blistered</a> cuticles, and <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/species/all/phenotype/WBPhenotype:0000409#0--10" target="_blank">variably abnormal</a> (head deformation). Interestingly, <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> scientists assign each locus a specific name corresponding to the phenotype of the mutant (or even with several names corresponding
                     to the diversity of phenotypes for different alleles at a locus). Instead, Sydney Brenner and the early worm geneticists,
                     facing the monotony of <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/species/all/phenotype/WBPhenotype:0000583#0--10" target="_blank">dumpys</a> and the somewhat greater variety of locomotion phenotypes (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000643;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">uncoordinated</a>, or <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000643;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">Unc</a>) opted for using the same phenotype name for many loci and numbering them: <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00001063;class=Gene" target="_blank">dpy-1</a></span>, <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/species/c_elegans/gene/WBGene00001064#0-9g-3" target="_blank"><span class="italic">dpy-2</span></a>&#8230; up now to <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006592;class=Gene" target="_blank">dpy-31</a>; <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/species/c_elegans/gene/WBGene00006741#0-9g-3" target="_blank"><span class="italic">unc-1</span></a>&#8230; <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00021078;class=Gene" target="_blank">unc-132</a>,</span> etc. (<a href="#bib41">Brenner, 1974</a>; <a href="#bib143">Horvitz et al., 1979</a>). This difference reflects both the systematic and abstract style of research that was adopted by <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> practitioners, as well as the paucity of obvious phenotypes. It also epitomizes the immediate need for complementation tests
                     by the <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> geneticist.
                  </p>
                  <p>Regarding phenotypes, Brenner et al. spotted and isolated other types of mutants, especially those producing bags of larvae.
                     It was known for a long time that adult hermaphrodites could fail to lay their fertilized embryos and be devoured by their
                     progeny hatching within the uterus. Maupas in particular gives vivid descriptions of the process (<a href="#bib186">Maupas, 1900</a>). In the Brenner lab conditions, with abundant food for the worms, this phenomenon did not occur with their wild-type strain.
                     Only mutants with defective egg-laying appeared as bags of larvae and they were actively screened for in Cambridge and later
                     in the laboratory of Robert Horvitz (<a href="#bib144">Horvitz and Sulston, 1980</a>; <a href="#bib310">Trent et al., 1983</a>). When analyzed at the tissue level, these mutations could affect either the egg-laying behavior, the formation of the neurons
                     or muscles necessary for it, or the formation of the vulva, which is the epithelial structure allowing for egg-laying. In
                     addition, a class of mutants with additional bumps on the ventral cuticle, named <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000700;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">multivulva</a>, corresponded to an excess of vulval formation. These bag-of-worms and <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000700;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">multivulva</a> mutants led the way to developmental genetics in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, while the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000643;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">uncoordinated</a> (together with mutants resistant to nematicide drugs) led to the genetics of neurobiology.
                  </p>
                  <p>For both development and neurobiology, the genetic analysis was accompanied by a heroic effort of the Brenner recruits towards
                     an extensive, often complete, description of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> at the cellular level. For development, Sulston and a small group of collaborators determined the complete cell lineage from
                     egg to adult&#8211;an amazing feat (<a href="#bib300">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</a>; <a href="#bib302">Sulston et al., 1983</a>; <a href="#bib157">Kimble and Hirsh, 1979</a>). They confirmed eutely and the quasi-invariance of development among individuals. As far as neurobiology was concerned,
                     John White, with Nichol Thompson and Eileen Southgate devoted 20 years to achieve the complete neuron connection map (<a href="#bib324">White et al., 1986</a>; <a href="#bib92">Emmons, 2015</a>) and other aspects of the worm anatomy. The development of laser ablation of cells by White allowed testing the role of a
                     cell in development or behavior (Sulston and White, 1980).
                  </p>
                  <p>This systematic effort alleviated the belatedness of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> as a model organism (e.g., compared to <span class="italic">Drosophila melanogaster</span>, which Morgan adopted in the 1900s). In addition, Sulston succeeded in cryopreserving <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> stocks, a key advantage over flies. Together with <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>&#8216; many other advantages, this 20-year long effort of a small number of scientists allowed <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> to become by the 1990s one of the main model organisms in biological research. Hundreds of laboratories have since adopted
                     it, many deriving in direct lineage from Brenner (some also adopted <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> independently), and form a close community sharing tools, a common database (Wormbase.org), meetings and informal communications.

               <p>Early on, Nigon was fascinated by the molecular biology of nucleic acids and was convinced that molecular genetics was the
                  future of genetics. Inspired by the works by Jean Brachet and Oswald Avery, he knew that a relationship between the nucleic
                  acids and a product of their activity must be sought. But it was unclear how to apply these notions to the genetics of eukaryotes,
                  and likely it was much too early. Robert Delavault, a colleague and collaborator in Paris, tried to stain and visualize nucleic
                  acids of several species of free-living nematodes (<a href="#bib72">Delavault, 1952a</a>; <a href="#bib73">Delavault, 1952b</a>; <a href="#bib74">Delavault and Nigon, 1952</a>). Later the Nigon team in Lyon succeeded in radioactive labeling of nucleic acids of various organisms. Jacqueline Nonnenmacher-Godet,
                  after initial work in Nigon's laboratory, went to Dougherty's laboratory and applied the radioactive labeling technique to
                  <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> DNA (Nonnenmacher-Godet and Dougherty, 1964).
               </p>
               <p>The molecular biology of the 1950-60s was built on methodological approaches such as crystallography, bacterial and phage
                  genetics, and biochemistry, and not on what we now call &#8220;molecular biology&#8221; techniques. These techniques only came in the
                  1970s with the discovery of restriction enzymes and the possibility of cloning DNA. Nigon participated in this work by studying
                  greening of bleached <span class="italic">Euglena</span> and thalassemic hemoglobin mutations in humans, leading him to the evolution of primate hemoglobins and the study of aviary
                  viruses carrying erythroblastosis genes. Brenner, despite being a main actor in the development of molecular biology, embraced
                  the genetics of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> in the 1960s without yet knowing how molecular biology could be brought to development and neurobiology studies. The cellular
                  level was the first anchor, but Brenner aimed at the molecular level for the future. Together with the first genetics paper
                  of 1974 (<a href="#bib41">Brenner, 1974</a>), Sulston and Brenner published a lesser known article where they quite correctly assessed the size and complexity of the
                  <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> genome using DNA reassociation kinetics (their estimation was 80 Mb for what we now know is 100 Mb) (<a href="#bib301">Sulston and Brenner, 1974</a>). But the way forward was not obvious. Brenner had considered the possibility of isolating nutritional mutants, as advocated
                  by Dougherty, as a possible route to clone genes (<a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>). He also considered complementing <span class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</span> mutants with <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> DNA to identify conserved genes (which we now know would not have worked because of introns) (<a href="#bib44">Brenner, 2001</a>). In the end, the first molecular identification of a <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> mutation used a biochemical approach: the abundance of muscle proteins allowed the identification of the <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006789;class=Gene" target="_blank">unc-54</a></span> gene, as encoding a myosin heavy chain (<a href="#bib96">Epstein et al., 1974</a>).
               </p>
               <p>Brenner reported: &#8220;Jim Watson, in particular, said he would not give me a penny for this work, complaining that I was 20 years
                  ahead of my time. What changed everything was the advent of cloning and sequencing. It opened up all of genetics and gave
                  us direct access to genes.&#8221; (<a href="#bib45">Brenner, 2009</a>). As Watson had supposed, molecular biology indeed only developed fully 20 years after Brenner started, when mutated genes
                  could be identified and rescued. Nigon's work was thus 40 years too early. Ironically, the way towards molecular biology is
                  what the Bergerac strain became most known for to <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> scientists of the 1980-90s. The first transposon type, called Tc1, was discovered through a restriction length polymorphism
                  between Bergerac and Bristol in Southern blots hybridized with different probes (<a href="#bib93">Emmons et al., 1979</a>). The high number of transposons and the transposition activity in the Bergerac strain then served as tools for gene identification
                  (<a href="#bib95">Emmons et al., 1983</a>; <a href="#bib169">Liao et al., 1983</a>; <a href="#bib197">Moerman and Waterston, 1984</a>; <a href="#bib90">Eide and Anderson, 1985</a>; <a href="#bib248">Plasterk and van Luenen, 1997</a>; <a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_transposons/transposons.html" target="_blank">Transposons in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span></a>). The hundreds of Tc1 transposons were used for genetic mapping and identification of mutated genes (<a href="#bib105">Finney et al., 1988</a>; <a href="#bib260">Ruvkun et al., 1989</a>; <a href="#bib325">Williams et al., 1992</a>). Moreover, the high transposition rate, at least of the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=RW7000;class=Strain" target="_blank">RW7000</a> subclone of Bergerac, could be used as a mutagen that rendered gene identification easier (<a href="#bib197">Moerman and Waterston, 1984</a>; <a href="#bib118">Greenwald, 1985</a>; <a href="#bib197">Moerman et al., 1986</a>).
               </p>
               <p>In the spirit of the cell lineage or the nervous system connectome, a physical map of the whole genome was built through a
                  new heroic enterprise by Sulston, together with Alan Coulson and Robert Waterston. They cloned the <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> genome in cosmids and yeast artificial chromosomes, building a physical map, which was progressively aligned with the genetic
                  map (<a href="#bib66">Coulson et al., 1986</a>; <a href="#bib65">Coulson et al., 1988</a>; <a href="#bib64">Coulson et al., 1995</a>). This led <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> to be the first animal to have its genome fully sequenced, from ordered clones (<a href="#bib307">The <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> Sequencing Consortium, 1998</a>) as a way towards the human genome sequence to which Sulston, Coulson, and Waterston then contributed (<a href="#bib299">Sulston and Ferry, 2002</a>).

            <p>The development of tools and a body of knowledge in a single species (the 4th phase of studies in our introduction) was undoubtedly
               the road to fundamental biological discoveries. <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> proved a terrific model organism for genetic analysis of a wide variety of molecular, cellular, developmental, physiological,
               and behavioral questions and remains so. On the other hand, by focusing on a single species and a single reference strain,
               other aspects of biology could not be studied: first, those concerning evolution and diversity; second, biological features
               that are not present in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>. Analyzing the many key discoveries that have been made using <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> is beyond the scope of this article. Instead we point below to several research directions that were primed by pre-Brenner
               studies and that seem to deserve in the future renewed or continued attention. Especially, we can now come back and use the
               amazing diversity of free-living nematodes to answer a variety of new questions pertaining to diversity in evolution.

               </div>
               <p>The initial interest in nematodes of early researchers, such as Boveri, B&uuml;tschli, van Beneden, Maupas, Kr&uuml;ger, P. Hertwig,
                  and B&#283;la&#345;, was triggered by the diversity of reproductive modes, based on the cytological diversity of meiosis and fertilization
                  events. After Nigon determined the XX/X0 chromosomal basis of sex determination in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> and correctly inferred that the ratio between X chromosomes and autosomes was the key, sex determination mechanisms were
                  further studied in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> using genetic screens, initially by Hodgkin and Brenner (<a href="#bib139">Hodgkin and Brenner, 1977</a>; <a href="#bib136">Hodgkin, 1988</a>; <a href="#bib138">Hodgkin, 2002b</a>). Single mutations could either transform XX animals into males (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/resources/gene_class/tra#01--10" target="_blank"><span class="italic">tra</span></a>), or X0 animals to females (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/resources/gene_class/fem#01--10" target="_blank"><span class="italic">fem</span></a>) or hermaphrodites (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/resources/gene_class/her#01--10" target="_blank"><span class="italic">her</span></a>), or be <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000062;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">lethal</a> specifically for X0 animals (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/resources/gene_class/xol#01--10" target="_blank"><span class="italic">xol</span></a>). The analysis of these mutants showed that a low ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes in males activates expression of the
                  <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006962;class=Gene" target="_blank">xol-1</a></span> gene and downstream production of the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE06617;class=Protein" target="_blank">HER-1</a> intercellular signaling molecule, which represses the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE23547;class=Protein" target="_blank">TRA-2</a> receptor and starts a cascade of signaling events in each cell throughout the animal. The ratio between X chromosomes and
                  autosomes is now known to be assessed by several X-linked and autosomal elements that were identified by Barbara Meyer et
                  al. (<a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_somaticsexdeterm/somaticsexdeterm.html" target="_blank">Somatic sex determination</a>).
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the partial independence between soma and germ line, some sex determination mutations called <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/resources/gene_class/fog#01--10" target="_blank"><span class="italic">fog</span></a> only feminize the hermaphrodite germ line. They transform XX hermaphrodites into true females without spermatogenesis, thus
                  dissociating the mechanisms of sexual differentiation of the gonad from that of the gametes, as predicted by Nigon. Analysis
                  of these mutants led to the understanding that the wild-type hermaphrodite germ line differentiates successively as male and
                  female through a temporal molecular switch from spermatogenesis to oogenesis: the action of the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE23547;class=Protein" target="_blank">TRA-2</a> receptor is first inhibited by <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE23287;class=Protein" target="_blank">FOG-2</a> (sperm formation) before being reactivated (<a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_sexgermline.2/sexgermline.html" target="_blank">Sex determination in the germ line</a>).
               </p>
               <p>From the knowledge of sex determination pathways, it became possible to manipulate at will the sex determination mechanisms
                  of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> using mutants. Transition between a hermaphrodite selfing mode of reproduction and a gonochoristic reproduction can be easily
                  achieved: mutants in a single gene, such as <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00001482;class=Gene" target="_blank">fog-2</a></span>, reproduce through females and males (<a href="#bib262">Schedl and Kimble, 1988</a>). Hodgkin could further produce all kinds of situations, including maternally or environmentally determined sex or other
                  forms of chromosomal sex determination (<a href="#bib137">Hodgkin, 2002a</a>).
               </p>
               <p>Once molecular details became clearer in <span class="italic">C. elegans,</span> in the last 20 years the evolution of sex determination and of the modes of reproduction in nematodes became again a center
                  of interest (<a href="#bib247">Pires-daSilva, 2007</a>). As inferred by the older authors, the transformation of a male-female species into a hermaphroditic one may be easy in
                  terms of mutational steps. In the gonochoristic <span class="italic">C. remanei</span>, mutations in only two independent pathways are sufficient to create hermaphroditic nematodes (<a href="#bib18">Baldi et al., 2009</a>). The <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis</span> genus is presently known to harbor three independent transitions to selfing (<a href="#bib159">Kiontke et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib309">Thomas et al., 2012</a>). An evolutionary consequence of these transitions is a great reduction in molecular diversity and the appearance of outbreeding
                  depression (the progeny or grand-progeny is less fit than the parents), contrasting with the observed inbreeding depression
                  in gonochoristic nematodes (<a href="#bib77">Dolgin et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#bib109">Gimond et al., 2013</a>). Recessive deleterious mutations can indeed be maintained at low frequencies in gonochoristic species, whereas they become
                  rapidly exposed in a homozygote combination in selfing species and are then efficiently purged by natural selection. The evolutionary
                  maintenance of males remains a key question under active study (<a href="#bib12">Anderson et al., 2010</a>). Spontaneous changes in mode of reproduction from the male-female mode (such as in <span class="italic">P. pellio</span>, with pseudogamy through males, <a href="#sec5.2.2" title="5.2.2.&nbsp;A pseudogamous mutant of Pellioditis pellio">Section 5.2.2</a>; or in <span class="italic">P. lheritieri,</span> <a href="#sec3.2" title="3.2.&nbsp;Variation in hermaphroditism among different species">Section 3.5</a>) have not been observed again to our knowledge. They could be looked for.
               </p>
               <p>In a thread running from Boveri, Maupas, and Nigon to recent work in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> (<a href="#bib256">Rog and Dernburg, 2013</a>; <a href="#bib179">Lui and Colaiacovo, 2013</a>), nematodes have been particularly instrumental in studies of meiosis. Now chromosomes or chromosome segments can be individually
                  marked, not only through genetic markers, but also using fluorescent probes (<a href="#bib204">Nabeshima et al., 2011</a>). Homologs find each other at the onset of meiosis through pairing at foci on the nuclear membrane, with different proteins
                  assembling the different chromosomes (<a href="#bib245">Phillips and Dernburg, 2006</a>; <a href="#bib256">Rog and Dernburg, 2013</a>). These pairing centers are anchored at the nuclear membrane through the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE32088;class=Protein" target="_blank">ZYG-12</a> protein (that with a missense mutation in Bergerac) (<a href="#bib261">Sato et al., 2009</a>). The sites of cross-overs can be marked and the regulation of cross-overs after double-stranded break formation is increasingly
                  understood (<a href="#bib256">Rog and Dernburg, 2013</a>; <a href="#bib312">Vader and Musacchio, 2014</a>). How these meiotic processes change during evolution is now a promising field of investigation.
               </p>
               <p>Among easily culturable members of the family Rhabditidae alone a wide variety of modes of reproduction with variations in
                  meiosis and fertilization are known: hermaphrodite-male, female-male, parthenogenetic (<span class="italic">Diploscapter</span> spp.), alternating generations (<span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> sp. SB347), pseudogamous hermaphrodite (<span class="italic">Rhabditis anomala</span> and <span class="italic">R. aberrans</span>, to be found again, possibly in frozen collections as &#8220;hermaphrodites&#8221;), and partially pseudogamous females and males (<span class="italic">Mesorhabditis belari</span>; <span class="italic">Mesorhabditis</span> sp. PS1179). This diversity is a great tool to study genetic mechanisms underlying such evolutionary switches, and their
                  evolutionary consequences. In contrast to the evolutionary transition to selfing, transitions towards parthenogenesis or pseudogamy
                  affect basic aspects of meiosis and fertilization, which remain to be studied. How do the cellular events leading to the evolution
                  of pseudogamy, parthenogenesis, or alternate generations evolve? How is the alternative between pseudogamy and true fertilization
                  controlled in the egg of <span class="italic">M. belari</span>?
               </p>
               <p>A further open field concerns the partial stability of tetraploids in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>. Questions concern: 1) the problem of dosage compensation between chromosomes in unusual chromosome formulas, and 2) meiotic
                  pairing and progression in a tetraploid situation.
               </p>
               <p>In conclusion, the diversity in modes of reproduction and meiosis is a historical legacy of research in nematodes, which can
                  be explored in terms of molecular regulation and evolution of cell biological processes, as well as for its impact on evolutionary
                  dynamics.

               <p>Brun's experiments of laboratory adaptation of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> to high temperature (<a href="#sec10" title="10.&nbsp;Adaptation to high temperature">Section 10</a>) were unconventional adaptation experiments because he used a very low population size&#8211;1-10 individuals per generation. Natural
                  selection is efficient at high population size. In addition, when starting, as Brun did, with a population harboring no starting
                  genetic diversity, a large population size also allows for incoming genetic variation through new mutation. Thus, the use
                  of a low population size may be appropriate in the case of non-genetic acclimatization but not a design for standard genetic
                  adaptation experiments.
               </p>
               <p>The use of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> in experimental evolution has started anew in the last 15 years, along the lines of standard population genetics (<a href="#bib117">Gray and Cutter, 2014</a>). The mode of reproduction and freezing ability of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> are great assets. Experiments of adaptation to novel environments have included pathogens (<a href="#bib200">Morran et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib271">Schulte et al., 2010</a>), high salt (<a href="#bib308">Theologidis et al., 2014</a>), as well as high temperature for <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> (<a href="#bib107">Gainutdinov et al., 2007</a>) and <span class="italic">C. remanei</span> (<a href="#bib279">Sikkink et al., 2014</a>). Experiments at a small population size have also been performed. A population size of one corresponds to the standard design
                  of mutation accumulation experiments, aimed at assessing the rate and distribution of mutational effects, most of them deleterious.
                  Mutation accumulation at a population size of one indeed results in a fitness decay (<a href="#bib316">Vassilieva et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib156">Keightley et al., 2000</a>). However, a population size of 10 basically alleviates deleterious effects of mutation accumulation (<a href="#bib98">Estes et al., 2004</a>). A reexpansion at high population size of low fitness lines allows for surprisingly rapid recovery (<a href="#bib97">Estes and Lynch, 2003</a>).
               </p>
               <p>A first exciting prospect concerns the mechanistic and evolutionary aspects of the <span class="italic">progressive</span> temperature-sensitive sterility observed by Brun. Although it may differ from that in Bergerac, progressive sterility at
                  25 &deg;C is common among <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> wild isolates (M.-A. F&eacute;lix, unpublished). The molecular and cellular basis of this progressive sterility and its evolutionary
                  significance in the regulation of transgenerational memory and in adaptation remain to be studied.
               </p>
               <p>A second question concerns the importance of prior non-genetic acclimatization in evolution, as opposed to direct genetic
                  (DNA-based) adaptation. Brun concluded that the adaptation he observed was of a non-genetic nature. Although this possibility
                  has been discounted by the synthetic theory of evolution in the mid-20th century, recent research on <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> and other organisms has uncovered molecular mechanisms whereby gene expression changes (potentially induced by the environment)
                  could be passed on to the progeny for several generations. This includes small RNAs in <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, which have been shown to be involved in physiological (same-generation) response to the environment (<a href="#bib102">F&eacute;lix et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib14">Ashe et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib154">Juang et al., 2013</a>), and may be passed on to the progeny (<a href="#bib119">Grishok et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib11">Alcazar et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib57">Burton et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib120">Gu et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib15">Ashe et al., 2012</a>). Recent demonstrations of multigenerational effects in a physiological wild-type context (<a href="#bib288">Sterken et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib253">Rechavi et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib254">Remy, 2010</a>; <a href="#bib270">Schott et al., 2014</a>) are interesting and remain to be reproduced by others. Their possible role in adaptation to the environment and their importance
                  and interplay relative to genetic variation under different circumstances are exciting open questions.

            <p>Bergerac is a town in the SouthWest of France, known to some for its wine or Cyrano de Bergerac, but to <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> scientists of a certain generation for a <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> strain with active transposons (but see below).
            </p>
            <p>The present Bergerac strain was isolated in 1944. While living in Bergerac in 1941-44, Nigon isolated <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> on two occasions from the garden of the house he lived in (see Biography, <a href="#sec18.4" title="18.4.&nbsp;Victor Marc Nigon (11 October 1920 - 5 July 2015)">Section 18.4</a>). The first strain was collected in October 1941; it was used in the work published in 1943 (<a href="#bib210">Nigon, 1943</a>) and discontinued at the end of 1942. A second strain was isolated in March 1944 in the same garden and is that known today
               as Bergerac. This second strain was sent to several laboratories that gave it various strain names, some of which indicate
               the culture location (Be for Berkeley, BO for Boulder), others are according to the later standardized strain nomenclature
               (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=CB4851;class=Strain" target="_blank">CB4851</a>, <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=DR1344;class=Strain" target="_blank">DR1344</a>, <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=RW7000;class=Strain" target="_blank">RW7000</a>, etc.). This sharing occurred before the freezing of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> strains was implemented. Therefore, as for the Bristol strain (<a href="#bib188">McGrath et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib189">McGrath et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib289">Sterken et al., 2015</a>), the Bergerac subclones diverged from the ancestor and from each other through the acquisition of new mutations (<a href="#figure23">Figure 23</a>). The present appendix aims at reconstituting this history, particularly pointing out that: 1) the temperature-sensitivity
               of Bergerac is not primarily due to transposition but to a temperature-sensitive point mutation in the <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006997;class=Gene" target="_blank">zyg-12</a></span> gene, common to all Bergerac subclones; and 2) the high level of Tc1 transposition activity that many <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> scientists associate with Bergerac only applies to the BO/<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=RW7000;class=Strain" target="_blank">RW7000</a> sublineage.

               <p>The original strain and its descendant lineage in Lyon were temperature-sensitive, displaying abnormalities from 23-24 &deg;C.
                  Males mated well and were used for crosses (<a href="#bib213">Nigon, 1949a</a>; <a href="#bib76">Dion and Brun, 1971</a>). The strain was maintained in Lyon at low temperatures and remained healthy. It was sent to the CGC in 1980, and frozen
                  under the name of Bergerac FR. <a href="#bib169">Liao et al.</a>, (1983) state that &#8220;The Bergerac FR strain has male fertility levels and brood sizes comparable with Bristol <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a>, while the Bergerac LY strain has low male fertility and brood sizes.&#8221; The strain is no longer available at the CGC and was
                  kindly provided to M.-A. F&eacute;lix by Mark Edgley and Donald Moerman. It is indeed healthy, compared to the other sublineages

               <p>Nigon shared the Bergerac strain with Dougherty in 1948. After several years of culture (perhaps in part in liquid), males
                  of the California strain could no longer mate well (<a href="#bib100">Fatt and Dougherty, 1963</a>). After Dougherty's death, Eder Hansen gave a subclone to David Hirsh (University of Colorado, Boulder) who used it for further
                  studies of heat sensitivity (<a href="#bib328">Wood et al., 1980</a>). William (Bill) Wood built a strain (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=BW54;class=Strain" target="_blank">BW54</a>) where the heat-sensitive locus from Bergerac was introduced by repeated crossing into the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a> background; this strain was later used for the identification of the <span class="italic">zyg-12(ct350ts)II</span> mutation by <a href="#bib183">Malone et al. (2003)</a>. The <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006997;class=Gene" target="_blank">zyg-12</a></span> mutation is also present in FR, <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=RW7000;class=Strain" target="_blank">RW7000</a> and <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=CB4851;class=Strain" target="_blank">CB4851</a> (genotyping by A. Richaud and M.-A. F&eacute;lix), indicating that the nucleotide substitution was likely already present in 1944
                  (or appeared shortly thereafter). This temperature-sensitive allele of <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006997;class=Gene" target="_blank">zyg-12</a></span> explains the temperature sensitivity of the Bergerac strain (see <a href="#sec9.3" title="9.3.&nbsp;Natural variation in temperature resistance">Section 9.3</a>). The Bergerac Be strain in <a href="#bib153">Johnson and Hutchinson (1993)</a> and the Bergerac DO mentioned in <a href="#bib168">Levitt and Emmons (1989)</a> seem to correspond to this sublineage via Dougherty in Berkeley.

               <p>The Bergerac strain was sent by Nigon to Brenner a first time in 1966 and again in 1969 when the first one was lost (<a href="#bib220">Nigon, 1966/1970</a>). Brenner called it N62. Once the strain nomenclature was standardized (<a href="#bib143">Horvitz et al., 1979</a>), this strain was renamed <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=CB4851;class=Strain" target="_blank">CB4851</a> (<a href="#bib140">Hodgkin and Doniach, 1997</a>). <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=CB4851;class=Strain" target="_blank">CB4851</a> is phenotypically &#8220;sick&#8221; (more so than FR) and has a high spontaneous male production (<a href="#bib140">Hodgkin and Doniach, 1997</a>). <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=CB4851;class=Strain" target="_blank">CB4851</a> also has a high Tc1 transposon content (<a href="#bib140">Hodgkin and Doniach, 1997</a>).

               <p>The BO/<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=RW7000;class=Strain" target="_blank">RW7000</a> Bergerac subclone is the best known to <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> scientists of the generation that was active in the 1980-90s, when it was used for genetic mapping using transposons and
                  for mutagenesis using transposase activity (see <a href="#sec12.2" title="12.2.&nbsp;The advent of molecular biology with C. elegans">Section 12.2</a>). This BO sublineage originated from a gift of a Bergerac culture by Jean Brun to David Hirsh in Boulder, CO in 1977 (<a href="#bib197">Moerman and Waterston, 1984</a>). This sublineage is a very <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000032;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">sick</a> derivative, which bears various names as it moved among laboratories and as strain nomenclature evolved: LY (&#8220;Lyon&#8221;), BO
                  (&#8220;Boulder&#8221;), <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=RW7000;class=Strain" target="_blank">RW7000</a>, <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=DR1344;class=Strain" target="_blank">DR1344</a>, EM1002, and <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=DP13;class=Strain" target="_blank">DP13</a> (<a href="#bib169">Liao et al., 1983</a>; <a href="#bib197">Moerman and Waterston, 1984</a>; <a href="#bib94">Emmons and Yesner, 1984</a>; <a href="#bib325">Williams et al., 1992</a>). While Hirsh's laboratory used the Dougherty Bergerac strain for <span class="italic">zyg-12(ts)</span> isolation, they used that originating from Brun in 1977 (BO) as a source of transposons. The BO subclone was found to contain
                  ~ 200-500 copies of the Tc1 transposon, compared to ~30 for <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a>, and these differences between BO and <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a> were used as polymorphisms for genetic mapping (<a href="#bib95">Emmons et al., 1983</a>; <a href="#bib89">Egilmez et al., 1995</a>; <a href="#bib162">Korswagen et al., 1996</a>). In addition, the BO sublineage evolved an increased Tc1 transposition activity in the germ line, at least 100-fold over
                  that of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a> and Bergerac FR (<a href="#bib197">Moerman and Waterston, 1984</a>), resulting in the appearance of phenotypic mutants in the culture (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/species/all/phenotype/WBPhenotype:0001222#0--10" target="_top">Mutator phenotype</a>). This transposon activity was used for mutagenesis and tagging (see <a href="#sec12.2" title="12.2.&nbsp;The advent of molecular biology with C. elegans">Section 12.2</a>). This increased transposon activity likely occurred through the activation of a transposon copy, forming the <span class="italic">mut-4(<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00248794;class=Variation" target="_blank">st700</a>)</span> <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/species/all/phenotype/WBPhenotype:0001222#0--10" target="_top">mutator</a> allele on chromosome <span class="italic">I</span>, which then hopped to other chromosomes, giving rise to <span class="italic">mut-5(<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00248795;class=Variation" target="_blank">st701</a>)II</span> and <span class="italic">mut-6(<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00248796;class=Variation" target="_blank">st702</a>)IV</span> (<a href="#bib199">Mori et al., 1988</a>). These <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0001222;class=Phenotype" target="_blank">mutator</a> alleles have not been molecularly identified. The Tc2 transposon also has an increased copy number compared to Bristol in
                  Bergerac subclones, including FR (<a href="#bib168">Levitt and Emmons, 1989</a>), while Tc3, Tc4, and Tc5 do not (<a href="#bib61">Collins, 1989</a>; <a href="#bib331">Yuan et al., 1991</a>; <a href="#bib62">Collins and Anderson, 1994</a>). Since <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=CB4851;class=Strain" target="_blank">CB4851</a> also has a high Tc1 transposon content (<a href="#bib140">Hodgkin and Doniach, 1997</a>) and BL1/SH, a later derivative from the Lyon lineage, has some detectable transposition activity (<a href="#bib197">Moerman and Waterston, 1984</a>), it appears likely that the ancestor of <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=CB4851;class=Strain" target="_blank">CB4851</a>, BO/<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=RW7000;class=Strain" target="_blank">RW7000</a>, and BL1 and maybe the original isolate already had a somewhat elevated level of Tc1 transposon and transposition activity,
                  which further increased in a dramatic fashion in the BO/<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=RW7000;class=Strain" target="_blank">RW7000</a> sublineage. In sum, the high transposition activity and extreme strain sickness only apply to the BO/<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=RW7000;class=Strain" target="_blank">RW7000</a>/etc. derivatives, not to the FR strain that was kept in Lyon.
               </p>
               <p>Note that the high-Tc1 content strains <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=DH424;class=Strain" target="_blank">DH424</a>, <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=TR403;class=Strain" target="_blank">TR403</a>, and <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=CB4555;class=Strain" target="_blank">CB4555</a>/<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=DR1349;class=Strain" target="_blank">DR1349</a> that were considered to be wild isolates of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> turned out to be recombinants between <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a> and a Bergerac subclone (apparently the same recombinant, likely a lab contamination from the start; <a href="#bib188">McGrath et al., 2009</a>).
               </p>
               <p>This account leaves several pending questions:</p>
               <p>1) How was the Tc1 transposase activity activated in the BO sublineage?</p>
               <p>2) Is there a relationship between the <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006997;class=Gene" target="_blank">zyg-12</a></span> mutation and the transposon activity?
               </p>
               <p>3) Whether wild strains of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> with elevated transposon activity exist remains to be studied.

               <p>Emile Maupas studied at the Ecole des Chartes in Paris to become an archivist, thus quite far from biology; his thesis concerned
                  legislation during the wars of the Middle Ages. He first worked as an archivist in Cantal in the center of France, and then
                  moved to Algiers (a French territory at the time) in North Africa, where he stayed from 1871 until his death in 1916. He became
                  the Head of the National Library of Algiers. His afternoons were devoted to the Library, and the rest of his time to his activities
                  as an &#8220;amateur&#8221; biologist. For the latter, he worked at home, a modest 3-room dwelling in the neighborhood of Bab el Oued,
                  overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The microscope was in front of the window; the rest of the &#8220;laboratory&#8221; (a few kitchen
                  plates with his cultures) could fit on the fireplace shelf (right picture; see Caullery, 1937).
               </p>
               <p>Maupas&#8217; curiosity focused on the biology of small organisms such as ciliates, nematodes, rotifers, and oligochaetes, which
                  he isolated from soil or freshwater. He developed culture methods to observe their development, reproduction, and sexuality&#8211;a
                  quite unusual endeavor at a time when the study of morphology predominated. He thus can be considered as one of the first
                  biologists who, with rudimentary equipment, applied the experimental method to basic biological questions, similar to that
                  developed in physiology by Claude Bernard.
               </p>
               <p>Maupas is perhaps best known for his studies of lineage degeneration in ciliates, where he showed that a given mitotically
                  reproducing clone had a finite lifetime, unless sexual reproduction occurred. He carefully observed their sexual reproduction
                  and correctly interpreted the exchange of micronuclei. In the context of the 1880s, observing sexuality in a single-cell organism,
                  and the role of the nucleus therein, was of major significance in attributing to the nucleus a role in heredity. Maupas also
                  studied sexuality in rotifers, and turned, in the last 20 years of his life, to using nematodes as model organisms. His interest
                  for nematodes concerned their lifecycles and the evolution of their diverse modes of reproduction (see main text). As an aside,
                  he described and named the several new species that he isolated and observed, including <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> (then <span class="italic">Rhabditis elegans</span>), clearly his favorite species in the 1900 opus.
               </p>
               <p>Despite Maupas&#8217; institutional and geographical isolation, the meticulousness of his experiments and the relevance of his interpretations
                  attracted the attention of great biologists, such as Otto B&uuml;tschli (another &#8220;protistologist&#8221; with an inclination for nematodes),
                  then Professor in Heidelberg, who obtained for Maupas the title of Doctor Honoris Causa of the University of Heidelberg in
                  1903. The French Academy of Sciences elected Maupas as a Correspondent in 1901 and awarded him the Grand Prize for the Physical
                  Sciences for his work on development and reproduction of nematodes. In 1932, the French zoologist Maurice Caullery erected
                  a plaque in his honor on his house in Algiers. He then gave a laudatory speech (Caullery, 1937), mentioning that he had never
                  met Maupas, but that B&uuml;tschli had expressed to him in 1891 his admiration for Maupas. Caullery was a key figure of French
                  zoology at the time, and the founder and head of the &#8220;Laboratoire d'Evolution des &Ecirc;tres Organis&eacute;s&#8221; (Laboratory of Evolution
                  of Organized Beings) at the University of Paris. He was succeeded in this role by Pierre-Paul Grass&eacute;, who hosted Victor Nigon
                  in his first years in Paris in this same (still standing) building on Boulevard Raspail (Caullery was then retired but still
                  around).
               </p>
               <p>A high school bears Maupas&#8217; name in Vire, Normandy (his birthplace) and in Skikda (formerly Philippeville, in Algeria). A
                  Maupas medal is still being awarded for great achievements in the ciliate scientific community.

               <p>Paula Hertwig grew up in a family of famous biologists: Oscar Hertwig was her father and Richard Hertwig her uncle. Throughout
                  her life, she was also close to her brother G&uuml;nther Hertwig, with whom she shared some scientific projects. Paula Hertwig
                  studied in Berlin and obtained her doctorate in 1916. Her first publication in 1911 reported on the abnormal divisions of
                  <span class="italic">Ascaris</span> eggs upon exposure to radium. She studied many organisms. Among them, she isolated free-living nematodes to study the cellular
                  basis of meiosis and fertilization and variations in modes of reproduction. In particular, she studied a spontaneous mutant
                  observed in <span class="italic">Rhabditis pellio</span> (see main text). Most remarkably, based on this work, in 1919 she was the first woman in Germany to obtain the Habilitation.
                  She became Privat-Dozent at the University of Berlin, despite a law barring women from obtaining faculty positions. Another
                  law also excluded married women from state employment, and she did not marry.
               </p>
               <p>In 1921, she became Assistant at the Institute of Genetics of the Agricultural College, which was directed by the plant geneticist
                  Erwin Baur. In particular, she studied the genetics of a hermaphroditic variant of Melandrium (<span class="italic">Silene dioica</span>). She also had a long-standing interest in the hybridization of animal species.
               </p>
               <p>She later focused on mouse genetics and induced mutagenesis. The work that made her famous concerned the mutagenic effects
                  of radiation; she was one of the first voices warning about their adverse effect. She isolated and studied many induced mouse
                  mutants, including some relevant to human disease, such as microphthalmia, oligodactyly, or the Hertwig-Weyers syndrom, named
                  after her.
               </p>
               <p>From 1927 to 1945, she was Extraordinary (Adjunct) Professor of Genetics at the Medical School of the University of Berlin.
                  She was politically active, elected in 1932 as representative of the liberal German Democratic Party in the Prussian Parliament.
                  After the war, she and her brother chose to live in the German Democratic Republic (GDR = East Germany). In 1948, she obtained
                  a Chair in Genetics at the Medical School of the University of Halle (GDR), where she also became the Dean. She headed a new
                  Institute of Genetics in this university. When Lysenko obtained political support in his rejection of genetics, which resulted
                  in the persecution of geneticists in the Soviet Union, she expressed herself against him. She was elected a member of the
                  Leopoldina, the German Academy of Sciences (then in East Germany), in 1953. After the death of her brother, she retired in
                  1972 to Villingen in the Black Forest in West Germany and, in 1973, became Doctor Honoris Causa of the University of Heidelberg.

               <p>B&#283;la&#345; (pronounced Bielarch) grew up in Vienna, in an intellectual environment. He studied zoology, had access to his brother-in-law's
                  private laboratory for his research, and defended his doctorate in protistology in 1919. From 1915 to 1918, he served in the
                  Austrian army. After his doctorate, he was invited to Berlin by Max Hartmann, director of a section at the Kaiser Wilhelm
                  Institute and protistologist, and became his assistant. In 1925, he obtained the title of Privatdozent of the University of
                  Berlin. His main work remained centered on protists, although he became interested in the use of nematodes. In 1929, he took
                  an invited professorship at The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in the new Division of Biology headed by Thomas
                  H. Morgan, and spent nearly two years in Pasadena, CA, USA. His main material there was the embryo of <span class="italic">Urechis</span>, a marine annelid. Just when he was due to return to Germany, he died in a car accident on a trip to the Mojave desert, where
                  he painted, one of his favorite hobbies.
               </p>
               <p>Like B&uuml;tschli and Maupas, B&#283;la&#345; mostly worked with protists, studying nematodes and other animals on the side. Although being
                  best known for his work in protistology, he had more general interests and was able to link his work in protistology to general
                  cytology matters. In protists, such as <span class="italic">Actinophrys sol</span>, he studied cell division and could draw parallels with the events of mitosis observed in animals. His later work concerned
                  the mechanistic aspects of cell division, including spindle mechanics. He was well-known for the quality of his drawings,
                  and was described as a rigorous and critical mind with wide-ranging intellectual interests, and especially as a gifted amateur
                  artist.
               </p>
               <p>His interest in consistent and varying features of cell division, particularly meiotic divisions and first mitotic divisions,
                  seems to have drawn him to <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> as a model. Following Eva Kr&uuml;ger and Paula Hertwig, he studied several <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> species where the sperm was required for fertilization yet sperm chromosomes degenerated upon entry into the egg (pseudogamy;
                  see Main text).
               </p>
               <p>He wrote several general works concerning cytological questions in genetics, including &#8220;Cytologische Grundlagen in Vererbungswissenschaft&#8221;
                  (1928; Cytological bases in the sciences of heredity). This book was a reference for V.M. Nigon; in the 1940s, it was the
                  only synthetic work concerning cytological approaches to heredity.
               </p>
               <p>When V.M. Nigon asked Professor Vandel for a subject for his Dipl&ocirc;me d'Etudes Sup&eacute;rieures (Master), which he could accomplish
                  while living 200 km from the university, Vandel referred to B&#283;la&#345;'s work. He mentioned a visit to B&#283;la&#345;'s laboratory, where
                  B&#283;la&#345; had shown him his nematode cultures and had told him about his nematode work.

               <p>How did you start working with Rhabditis? This question was often asked of me. It was an exceptional combination of circumstances.</p>
               <p>I was born in 1920 in France, in the department of Moselle. Local history played a large influence in my personal life. Europe
                  had been largely united in the Roman Empire, but after Charlemagne's reign, it fell into pieces, each one under the power
                  of local kings or princes. The territory of Moselle was a part of the Dukedom of Lorraine, where the official language was
                  French, but at its Northern border in Moselle a small part of the territory traditionally used a German dialect and was thus
                  known as &#8220;bailliage d'Allemagne&#8221;. My family had lived in this territory since the 16th century. While speaking at home a German
                  dialect, some family members participated in the French-speaking administration of Lorraine. It took over ten centuries to
                  rebuild large countries like France and Germany. Lorraine was incorporated into France in the 17th and 18th centuries. The
                  unification of Germany occurred later, in the second half of the 19th century, and strove to include all German-speaking regions.
                  After France's defeat in 1871, together with Alsace, Germany thus annexed the Moselle department. However, during years of
                  association with French-speaking Lorraine, the German-speaking Lorraine had adopted French traditions, such as the practice
                  of the Roman Catholic religion (while most regions of Germany were following the Lutheran Reform). For such reasons, the annexation
                  of a part of Lorraine by Germany was not universally accepted and Moselle returned to France after the German defeat of 1918.
                  In 1940, the German Nazi power decided unilaterally to re-annex Moselle. From past experience they knew that annexing a French-speaking
                  part would result in local opposition. They thus decided to expel to France 200,000 French-speaking people in September and
                  October, 1940. My parents, over 60 years of age and partly German-speaking from childhood, could stay. I easily spoke German
                  and had visited a large part of Germany in 1937 and 1938. I appreciated German literature, philosophy, and science. But I
                  gained there a profound aversion to Hitler's politics. Thus, my decision in 1940 was to avoid a German status. My parents
                  approved of my choice. When asked by the German administration they declared that I had been transferred overseas by the French
                  army. They advised me to avoid any contact with the German police, who continued to inquire about me. If I fell into their
                  hands, I would be obliged to choose: either my return to German Lorraine, or the departure of my parents. I thus had to live
                  in the highest discretion, avoiding any contact with Germans. This obliged me to live in the non-occupied zone of France (Note:
                  roughly the South half of France, but the demarcation line run diagonally in the SouthWest, leaving Bordeaux in the occupied
                  zone while Bergerac and Toulouse were in the non-occupied one). This history was a key background, to which I will return
                  below, for why I ended up working on <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, while stranded in Bergerac as a consequence of the war and my Lorraine origins.
               </p>
               <p>From the age of 12, I had decided to become a scientist. At 16 I had entered the University of Paris as a medical student
                  (1936). My plan was to prepare to enter the Pasteur Institute in Paris. I had developed a passion for tropical diseases. Their
                  study would conciliate my passion for scientific research, my social inclinations towards poor people, and my taste for travel.
                  Yet I got rapidly disappointed by the archaic character of medical studies at French Universities. During my second year I
                  met a Laboratory head of the Pasteur Institute, who explained to me that only half of the personnel had a medical degree,
                  while the other half had a science degree. My decision was immediate&#8211;the next year, I abandoned the medical curriculum and
                  registered at the Faculty of Sciences, which conformed better to my expectations.
               </p>
               <p>In 1940, my parents, devoid of French money, could no longer finance my studies. I thus had to earn my living, while continuing
                  my studies. At the University of Lyon (in the non-occupied zone), I obtained a low-paid position in Geology, a discipline
                  that did not interest me. I got married, very early. The mother of my spouse died in March 1941. Her father asked my wife,
                  who was the oldest of his children, to settle close to him to help raising his younger children. He offered us a house, a
                  support through his relationships with surrounding farmers and, for me, help in finding private lessons to teach. He lived
                  in Bergerac, a small town that was very appropriate for my need to be discreet. The only difficulty was the distance to the
                  University of Toulouse, the closest one in the non-occupied zone&#8211;practically I could not attend the courses. I went to Toulouse
                  to consult Professor Vandel who headed the sector of Animal Biology. He received me with a great understanding and the willingness
                  to help me. I am happy to express here a tribute of gratitude to his memory. Professor Vandel gave me a list of works to study
                  and introduced me to his best students, who gave me their notes on the classes and practicals. I complemented these documents
                  with popular books about genetics and embryology. I passed the exam in October 1941, being the top-ranked student, with the
                  best possible mark.
               </p>
               <p>I could no longer hope to work in the Pasteur Institute, located in German-controlled France. With my wife, we prepared a
                  project for me to teach in French schools in a foreign country, possibly the United States. After the war, I might have been
                  able to obtain such a teaching position and take part in a research lab in the United States. Before this, my next academic
                  step was a year dedicated to work in a laboratory, on a subject that usually implied reproducing data from the literature,
                  with a written dissertation and an oral examination at the end. Unable to pursue work at the University, I had to perform
                  this experimental study at home with rudimentary instrumentation. I proposed this to Professor Vandel, who immediately accepted.
                  He told me about Maupas, of whom he had helped publishing a posthumous article, and of B&#283;la&#345;, whom he had met. He was attracted
                  by the simple requirements of the <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> culture, which I could likely manage. Apparently, he had not grasped the further potential of this material. He likely hoped
                  that, by repeating these experiments, I would confirm, and maybe elaborate on the ambiguous results of Maupas on crosses.
                  I immediately accepted.
               </p>
               <p>The first hermaphroditic nematode that I isolated turned out to be the famous <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> described by Maupas and I did not search further. I placed some garden soil in a kitchen plate and maintained its humidity
                  by covering it. On the plate, I added diverse items as traps. I remember using carrot slices and also earthworm pieces from
                  the same garden, cut with scissors! Two or three days later I transferred the trap with some surrounding soil onto a Petri
                  dish with Knop agar. I waited until the Petri dish was swarming with larvae and tried to transport to a new plate the smallest
                  possible number of animals. One day later, they were adults and visible with the naked eye, which allowed me to catch one
                  with the tip of a scalpel and seed a new plate with a single individual. All this without a dissecting microscope at hand:
                  I only had an old Stiassnie microscope offered by my parents at the beginning of my medical studies. By proceeding in this
                  manner, I hoped to select a hermaphroditic species, which I could monitor by observing with my microscope that there were
                  only females. I then needed to hunt for the rare males that would allow me to determine the species. I do not remember having
                  had to proceed through numerous identifications to isolate the <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> that I was looking for, based on the initial data by Maupas.
               </p>
               <p>My readings of the prior studies struck me by the rudimentary character of the culture methods that were used. They contrasted
                  with what I knew of the rigorous methods used by Morgan for <span class="italic">Drosophila</span>. I thus decided to develop for <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> a more rigorous culture method. Within two months, I invented a method of breeding isolated animals on a drop of agar, bringing
                  nutrients to the culture, with daily transfers of the parents to fresh medium, which, in a few weeks, gave males in great
                  quantity. These results impressed Vandel and I wrote a short article relating them (<a href="#bib210">Nigon, 1943</a>).
               </p>
               <p>After my diploma, I had to participate in &#8220;Chantiers de Jeunesse&#8221;, which corresponded to practical work that replaced military
                  training in the &#8220;free&#8221; zone of France. But I soon had to face a new danger: at the beginning of 1943, the French government
                  decided to send those of my age to Germany as compulsory workers. The German police would easily then identify my origin from
                  the German-speaking part of Lorraine and I immediately decided to prevent this. With the help of local medical doctors, I
                  simulated an accident with a broken foot. This resulted in six weeks in the military hospital with my foot in a cast. When
                  I came back to the Chantier, all of those of my age had been transferred to Germany. I had prepared a possible fallback in
                  the maquis in case of danger.
               </p>
               <p>Some time later, I asked Vandel about future possibilities. Naively, I told him of my project to emigrate to the United States.
                  He then informed me about the projects that, with other Professors, doubtless in Resistance networks, he planned for France
                  once liberated. At that time, Germany had lost Stalingrad and was starting to retreat. Many French people were beginning to
                  think that a German defeat was conceivable. Vandel told me that two months after the installation in Paris of a Free French
                  Government, the CNRS would reopen, creating jobs for young scientists. So I should be in Paris at the time of the liberation.
                  He had already talked about me to Parisian colleagues who were ready to host me. After my studies, I had obtained a well-paid
                  job as a chemist in a company in Bergerac, which allowed us to spare the necessary sum for me to spend six months in Paris,
                  while my wife and children would stay in Bergerac, with her father's family. I thus moved to Paris, alone, in April 1944.
               </p>
               <p>I was received by Professor Grass&eacute;, who installed me in a laboratory, with dream equipment compared to what I had at home
                  in Bergerac. Paris was liberated in August. On 1<sup>st</sup> October, my project on <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> was accepted by the CNRS. I was recruited as a research trainee with a monthly salary of 1000 Francs, a fourth of my salary
                  in Bergerac. It was difficult to support a family with this amount. My wife managed to do so, to the amazement of my friends.
                  In sum, so far my path towards <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> resulted from an encounter with Vandel, with, for me, difficult conditions of living. For Vandel, the lineage was Maupas
                  and B&#283;la&#345;, yet apparently without a deep conviction concerning its interest. It was only through my work in Paris that the
                  richness of the <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> project struck me.
               </p>
               <p>In 1948, I hosted a visit from Ellsworth Dougherty, who spent six months with me, learning to use the experimental method
                  as scientific approach. Our discussions helped us to enlarge the scope of our projects. The misfortunes of the war, the extreme
                  poverty, the cobbled-together equipment, the life with rudimentary comfort, the political climate, etc.: all this deeply marked
                  scientific research in France at that time. Today's scientists cannot imagine the influence of these work conditions and the
                  approaches of researchers in this period. When Ellsworth came to France, he told me of his surprise at this work atmosphere,
                  which he had never experienced. These ascetic conditions, according to him, played an important role in stimulating the creativity
                  of scientists. He had never worked with such intensity and concentration.
               </p>
               <p>I defended my thesis (Ph.D.) in the spring of 1948. On 1st October 1949, I was appointed Lecturer at the University of Lyon.
                  Access to an academic position entailed establishing a research program, with the participation of young researchers. I had
                  reached, at this point, a quite clear view of the potential of <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span>. I had some experience with cytology and saw a future with genetics. Yet, in line with a French tradition, the genetics of
                  the time, including the remarkable results of Morgan, appeared to me to suffer from major problems, resulting especially from
                  the abstract character of the gene. It allowed the development of unverifiable theories, such as the theory of polygenes.
                  A way to avoid this abstract theory was through the birth of what has become Molecular Biology; the genetic role of DNA was
                  just proven at this time by Avery's experiments on bacteria. I was thus wondering how to access molecular biology starting
                  from <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span>. The only answer I could give was to associate, in one program, several experienced researchers&#8211;at least a geneticist and
                  a biochemist. Around me, I searched for candidates and only found young students, without experience. Most experienced researchers
                  considered molecular biology as an unreachable utopia. Nevertheless, I searched for the support of influential Professors.
                  This again was a failure. Evidently, this project could not succeed in France. The choice was limited to continuing on nematodes,
                  forgetting, at least for a while, molecular biology. Or, follow my quest towards molecular biology by testing other material,
                  on which more advanced knowledge could shorten the way towards molecular biology. In 1953, I chose the second path.
               </p>
               <p>At that time, I had already started to train some students in research. Two of them wished to continue on the nematodes: Jean
                  Brun, who worked on this subject until his death, and Pierre Guerrier, tied to his video camera. Later, Guerrier continued
                  to study the first cleavage divisions, this time in marine Spiralia.
               </p>
               <p>In the 1953-1965 period, I had defined an aim&#8211;to find transmissible characters in a eukaryotic species, with which one should
                  be able to study the path from the gene to the results of its expression. Following this aim, I tried several species, including
                  <span class="italic">Drosophila</span>, the silkworm, and the green alga <span class="italic">Euglena</span>. I performed this research with young students. If, after a few years, I could not obtain the desired results on one species,
                  I moved to another. Several of my young collaborators then chose to continue on the material that I had left behind. The sought-after
                  result came with the work on <span class="italic">Euglena</span> bleached by culturing them in the dark and brought back to light. One could observe the formation of chloroplasts and perhaps
                  determine the mechanism. We examined ground extracts of greening cells after ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient. I
                  immediately recognized the signal of polysomes, already described in bacteria, sea urchin eggs, and erythropoietic cells.
                  This was one of the results I was looking for, as it could result from the expression of the mysterious chloroplastic DNA.
               </p>
               <p>It took us over 13 years to reach this result. During this time, molecular biology had taken shape and established the central
                  molecular mechanisms from DNA, ribosomal, messenger, and transfer RNAs, to proteins. We only reached the result in <span class="italic">Euglena</span> through biochemical exploration. This was pursued in parallel by scientists who were qualified in genetics and in biochemistry.
                  Had we known this mechanism earlier, we could likely have reached the sought-after result on all species we studied, including
                  the nematodes! Said otherwise, abandoning the nematodes had been a mistake. During this time, it would have been better to
                  acquire the missing experience in genetics and apply it to <span class="italic">Rhabditis.</span>.. If Dougherty and myself had taken up this direction, the scene would have been changed, for both of us. It was the great
                  merit of Brenner: wiser than us, he attacked the nematode only after sufficient experience in Genetics and Molecular Biology!
               </p>
               <p>For those who may be interested in my later works, they are well documented on PubMed, under my name. Only missing are the
                  studies I conducted from 1995 to 1999, on adaptation to high altitude, in La Paz (Bolivia), at 3700 meters. This work was
                  interrupted by the death of my wife and health problems for me, despite some first results possibly oriented towards the discovery
                  of epigenetic processes (still unpublished).

               <p>Ellsworth Dougherty graduated in Zoology at a young age in 1940, and obtained his PhD in 1944 at the University of California
                  in Berkeley. He served in 1944 in the health corps of the US Marines. He then completed his medical studies as a veteran (MD,
                  1946)<span class="italic">.</span> As a recipient of a Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship (1947-49), he worked at Caltech and visited France where he stayed in
                  the laboratory of Victor Nigon. After this fellowship, he practiced as a physician in a Kaiser Permanente Foundation hospital
                  in Richmond, CA, and also taught at the University of California in Berkeley.
               </p>
               <p>His first studies concerned systematics of parasitic nematodes. His first work on a free-living nematode, <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> (<span class="italic">pellio)</span>, took place in Pasadena. He contacted Victor M. Nigon and spent about six months in 1948 working with him in Paris, also
                  attending the International Congress of Zoology that took place in Paris that year. In 1951-52, he came for a second visit
                  to Nigon's laboratory in Lyon for nearly a year. In 1957, he established a laboratory of &#8220;Comparative Physiology and Morphology&#8221;
                  in the research section of the Kaiser Foundation in Richmond, California. In 1960, he moved to the Department of Nutritional
                  Sciences at the University of California in Berkeley. He joined several scientific trips to Antarctica. He visited Lyon again
                  several times. A last short visit took place in 1961. He had previously suffered from depression that had led him to a first
                  suicide attempt. One of his friends in Lyon, a Professor at the Medical Faculty, organized in his honor an impressive reception.
                  He committed suicide in December 1965.

               <p>&#8220;<span class="italic">We had contracted a deep friendship. Ellsworth had a very imaginative mind and was not naturally an experimenter, yet, by
                     being in contact with me, he got trained and enjoyed the experimental method. In the early 1960s, he hosted in his laboratory
                     Jacqueline Nonnenmacher-Godet, a student from my laboratory (who has served as the head of CNRS Life Sciences in 1999-2002
                     and is currently President of the French League against Cancer).&#8221;&#8211;</span>Victor M. Nigon.
               </p>
               <p>E. Dougherty was deeply influenced by George Beadle's results on the biochemical genetics of <span class="italic">Neurospora</span> and developed the project to study nutritional mutants, in an animal where the morphology allowed little morphological variation
                  by mutation. He greatly contributed to the nomenclature and development of culture methods of small animals.
               </p>
               <p>He was a strong advocate of using <span class="italic">Rhabditis</span> as model organisms (Dougherty and Calhoun, 1948; <a href="#bib78">Dougherty, 1949</a>). Some of his obvious contributions to present-day <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> research are: description of <span class="italic">R. briggsae</span> with NIgon (<a href="#bib86">Dougherty and Nigon, 1949</a>); axenic cultivation of <span class="italic">R. briggsae</span> (<a href="#bib79">Dougherty, 1950</a>); raising <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis</span> from a subgenus to a genus (Dougherty, 1953); performing the first genetic analysis of <span class="italic">C. briggsae</span> with Nigon (<a href="#bib224">Nigon and Dougherty, 1950</a>) and of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> Bergerac x <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a> with Helene Fatt (<a href="#bib100">Fatt and Dougherty, 1963</a>); and sending <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" target="_blank">N2</a> to Sydney Brenner (<a href="#bib82">Dougherty, 1963</a>).

               </p>
               <p>Jean Brun's early youth was spent in La Chapelle-de-Mardore, a small village in the Beaujolais region in France. He came from
                  a modest family. His father, a farmer, died from an old World War I wound when Jean Brun and his older brother were young
                  boys. His mother remarried and moved to Lyon, where Jean Brun went to school and was found to excel. Pushed by his teachers,
                  and against his mother's wish that he would work, he continued until the high school degree. Then, needing to work, he combined
                  being a school supervisor in Roanne with studying at the University in Lyon, which he reached through a long bike ride. He
                  met his future wife Genevi&egrave;ve at the university and both joined VM Nigon's laboratory in 1949. While she and others worked
                  for their diplomas on <span class="italic">Ascaris</span>, Jean Brun started a project on <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, the species he was to continue with all his life. He obtained an assistant position at the University of Lyon in 1949.
               </p>
               <p>Jean Brun first studied gametogenesis of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span>, especially chromosome pairing in meiotic prophase. He then described gametogenesis defects at high temperature, including
                  chromosomal abnormalities and cell fusions leading to polyploidy. He experimented with the effects of high temperature on
                  fertility, which led him to the discovery of the progressive decline in fertility over several generations at intermediate
                  temperatures. From there, he patiently adapted the Bergerac strain to 24.5&deg;C, with 0.5&deg;C temperature steps and after hundreds
                  of generations. Through many thorough experiments of temperature reversions, he was led to the conclusion that this adaptation
                  may not be of conventional genetic nature (see main text). Jean Brun was very involved and dedicated to his work. He obtained
                  his &#8220;Doctorat d'Etat&#8221; in March 1966 with his work on <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> temperature adaptation.

               <p>Jean Brun and Ellsworth Dougherty were then both interested in developing <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> genetics. They had planned for the former to come to Berkeley with his family for the 1966-1967 academic year&#8211;a project sadly
                  interrupted by Dougherty's untimely death in December 1965.
               </p>
               <p>From 1967, Jean Brun developed in Lyon an independent research team focused on <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> biology and genetics. The team isolated the first mutants of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> (see main text). Jean Brun became an Assistant Professor and became involved in the direction of the academic part of the
                  Biology Department of the University.
               </p>
               <p>The rise of <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> through Sydney Brenner, with his scientific aura, was obviously of great importance for the Brun team. They participated
                  in the budding <span class="italic">C. elegans</span> scientific community through Worm Breeder Gazettes and the first 1977 Worm Meeting in Woods Hole, MA. Jean Brun and his wife
                  visited David Hirsh in Boulder, CO (in 1976 or 1977). In the later years, Jean Brun developed cancer, yet kept working and
                  following the progress of his team until his death in 1981. Members of the team finished their ongoing studies and published
                  until 1985, then dispersed to other laboratories.
