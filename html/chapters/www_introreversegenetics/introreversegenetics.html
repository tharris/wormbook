            <p>Through genetic analyses, the function of genes is investigated by studying organisms where gene function is altered. In classical
               forward genetic screening, individuals are treated with mutagens to induce DNA lesions and mutants with a phenotype of interest
               are sought. After a mutant is found, the gene mutated is identified through standard molecular techniques. Detailed studies
               of the mutant phenotype coupled with molecular analyses of the gene allows elucidation of the gene's function. Forward genetics
               has been responsible for our understanding of many biological processes and is an excellent method for identifying genes that
               function in a particular process.
            </p>
            <p>In reverse genetics, the functional study of a gene starts with the gene sequence rather than a mutant phenotype. Using various
               techniques, a gene's function is altered and the effect on the development or behaviour of the organism is analysed. Reverse
               genetics is an important complement to forward genetics. For example, using reverse genetics, one can investigate the function
               of all genes in a gene family, something not easily done with forward genetics. Further, one can study the function of a gene
               found to be involved in a process of interest in another organism, but for which no forward genetic mutants have yet been
               identified. Finally, the vast majority of genes have not yet been mutated in most organisms and reverse genetics allows their
               study. The availability of complete genome sequences combined with reverse genetics can allow every gene to be studied.
            </p>
            <p>This chapter gives detailed protocols for the two main methods of perturbing gene function in <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span>: RNA interference and the creation of deletion mutants. Either technique can be applied to the study of individual genes.
               With less than a day of actual work, RNAi creates a knockdown of gene function without altering the organism's DNA (see below).
               In contrast, with about a month of work, a deletion mutation permanently removes all gene function. Deciding which technique
               to use will depend on the nature of the experiment. The techniques can also be combined, where RNAi is used for rapid screening
               of loss of function phenotypes and then deletion mutants are made to study genes of particular interest. RNAi can also be
               carried out on a global scale, where knockdown of (nearly) every gene is tested for inducing a phenotype of interest. In this
               case, the reverse genetics technique of RNAi can be thought of as a forward genetic screening tool.

            <p>In 1998, Fire and Mello discovered that injection of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) into worms leads to specific degradation
               of the corresponding mRNA, a process termed RNA interference (RNAi; <a href="#bib9">Fire et al., 1998</a>). Soon afterwards, it was found that either soaking worms in dsRNA solution or feeding worms bacteria engineered to produce
               dsRNA also could induce a robust RNAi response (<a href="#bib16">Tabara et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#bib18">Timmons and Fire, 1998</a>). The technique of RNAi, coupled with the availability of the complete genomic sequence of <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> (<a href="#bib8">Consortium, 1998</a>), has made possible the rapid study of gene function, both on a single gene level and at a global scale. This section discusses
               general features to consider when using this technique. Sections following this give detailed protocols for RNAi by injection,
               soaking and feeding.

                  </div>
               </div>
               <p>There are three ways to carry out RNAi in <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span>: injection (<a href="#bib9">Fire et al., 1998</a>), soaking (<a href="#bib16">Tabara et al., 1998</a>), and feeding (<a href="#bib18">Timmons and Fire, 1998</a>). All three can produce efficient gene knockdowns. Which method to use will depend on your particular experiment.
               </p>
               <p><span class="underline">RNAi by injection:</span> dsRNA produced <span class="emphasis"><em>in vitro</em></span> is injected into young adult hermaphrotides and the progeny scored for mutant phenotypes. RNAi by injection gives very reliable
                  gene inhibition from worm to worm, but is more labor intensive than other methods. A small transcription reaction produces
                  5&#8211;10 &#956;g dsRNA, which is sufficient to conduct many experiments.
               </p>
               <p><span class="underline">RNAi by soaking:</span> worms are soaked in a high concentration dsRNA solution and then subsequently they or their progeny scored for phenotypes.
                  RNAi by soaking is useful for treating a moderately large number of animals (e.g., tens to hundreds) or for high throughput
                  screening in 96 well format. Worms of any stage can be soaked. More dsRNA is needed for soaking than for injection (5&#8211;10 &#956;g
                  per experiment).
               </p>
               <p><span class="underline">RNAi by feeding:</span> bacteria producing the desired dsRNA are fed to worms and either they or their progeny are scored. RNAi by feeding is the
                  least labor intensive and most inexpensive method, but produces slightly more variable results than RNAi by soaking or injection.
                  RNAi by feeding can be used to treat a large number of animals at once or for high throughput screening, both on agar plates
                  and in liquid culture. Worms of any stage can be subjected to RNAi by feeding.

               <p>This will depend on the nature of the experiment. Worm strains and tissues differ in their sensitivity to RNAi. For many phenotypes
                  and assays, using wild type worms will give good results. However, in some cases, phenotypes are seen in RNAi supersensitive
                  strains [e.g., <span class="emphasis"><em><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=rrf-3" target="_blank">rrf-3</a></em></span> (<a href="#bib15">Simmer et al., 2002</a>) <span class="emphasis"><em><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=eri-1" target="_blank">eri-1</a></em></span> (<a href="#bib13">Kennedy et al., 2004</a>) or <span class="emphasis"><em><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=eri-1" target="_blank">eri-1</a></em></span>; <span class="emphasis"><em><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=lin-15B" target="_blank">lin-15B</a></em></span> (Wang et al., 2005)] but not in wild-type, or are stronger in RNAi supersensitive strains, so it is a good idea to try these
                  as well. <span class="emphasis"><em><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=rrf-3" target="_blank">rrf-3</a></em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=eri-1" target="_blank">eri-1</a></em></span> have lower brood sizes than wild-type and are sterile at 25&deg;C, so they require a bit more attention. The sterility can be
                  overcome by mating with males.

               <p>Again, this will depend on your experiment and assay. RNAi by injection is usually carried out on adult hermaphrodites, and
                  the progeny assayed. Injecting younger worms is possible but more difficult. Any stage of worms can be fed or soaked, but
                  one of two stages are usually used: L3/L4s or starved L1s. For feeding, it is desirable to allow the worms to feed for 2&#8211;3
                  days before they or their progeny are assayed. In general, feeding or soaking L3/L4 worms is used if the assay will be carried
                  out on the progeny. If the assay will be on the RNAi treated worms, then starved L1s or later stages can be used. It is also
                  possible to assay the progeny of RNAi treated L1s. However, it is important to keep in mind that phenotypes observed can differ
                  depending on which stage is used. For example, RNAi of some genes causes sterility of the fed worm if L1s are used whereas
                  embryonic lethality is induced if L4s are used. (S. Woods, D. Rivers, and J. Ahringer, unpublished). Therefore, if the assay
                  will be on embryos, then it may not be a good idea to use L1s.

               <p>Induction of a phenotype is a reliable indication of a positive RNAi result, as the level of false positives is extremely
                  low (&lt;1%, <a href="#bib12">Kamath et al., 2003</a>). However, it is more difficult to draw conclusions from a negative RNAi experiment; the false negative rate is about 30%
                  over all genes, and varies depending on the tissue (<a href="#bib12">Kamath et al., 2003</a>). Using RT-PCR, you can test whether the mRNA has been knocked down. However, the protein product could still be present
                  even if the mRNA is undetectable. Some proteins are stable over many days. An antibody can be used to measure the level of
                  protein reduction. It is important to be cautious when drawing conclusions following a negative RNAi experiment, as it is
                  possible that a small amount of residual protein is sufficient for gene activity.

               <p>When targeting more than one gene by RNAi, the efficiency of knockdown may be reduced when compared to targeting each gene
                  separately (e.g., see Table 1 in <a href="#bib11">Gonczy et al., 2000</a>). This may not be a problem for some experiments. For example, if two genes each have no detectable RNAi phenotype, but targeting
                  them together causes a phenotype, then this would show some overlap in function. However, if you are carrying out an epistasis
                  experiment, reduced RNAi efficiency may lead to an inaccurate result, if only one of the two genes is efficiently knocked
                  down. Therefore, it is ideal to target one gene by RNAi in the mutant background of the other gene. If it is not possible
                  to use a mutant, then use antibodies to test that the level of protein knockdown is the same in the double and single RNAi
                  experiments for both genes.

               <p>It is essential to optimize screening conditions before embarking on a large-scale screen. If at all possible, assemble a
                  set of control genes that you expect to be positive in your screen, and a set of genes you expect to be negative. Test these
                  under different conditions (e.g., different temperature, stage of worm fed, background, plate configuration, etc) to find
                  the highest hit rate and fastest screening time. Carrying out these controls will save time and make your final list of positive
                  candidates more specific. Positive hits should be rescreened to ensure reproducibility. If possible, is it a good idea to
                  design and carry out a different, second assay on your positive candidate genes to ensure they are involved in the process
                  you are studying.

               <p>There are currently two RNAi feeding libraries for <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span>. One is from the Ahringer lab and has 16,757 clones, made by cloning gene-specific genomic fragments between two inverted
                  T7 promoters (<a href="#bib10">Fraser et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib12">Kamath et al., 2003</a>). The inserts contain exons and introns and sizes vary from 500 bp to 2.5 kb. The other is from the Vidal lab and has 11,511
                  clones, made by the Gateway cloning of full-length open reading frame (ORF) cDNAs into a double T7 vector (<a href="#bib14">Rual et al., 2004</a>). Both libraries use the HT115 bacterial strain as a host for the plasmid RNAi clones; HT115 has IPTG inducible T7 polymerase
                  and a disruption of the RNAse III gene (a dsRNAse), the latter marked with Tetracycline resistance (<a href="#bib17">Timmons et al., 2001</a>). There is some overlap between the two libraries; together they can target about 94% of <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> genes. Individual clones and whole libraries are available from <a href="http://www.geneservice.co.uk/products/rnai/" target="_top">Geneservice</a>.

               <p>As there are some errors in any library, you should sequence any clone you are going to work with to ensure you know which
                  gene is being targeted (single genes or positives from a screen). It is also a good idea to look for potential cross interference
                  (where RNAi of one gene inhibits the intended target gene as well as a closely related gene) using BlastN to compare the sequence
                  of the RNAi template with <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> genes. So far, there is no hard and fast rule for predicting cross interference. A reasonable guide is that if there is 80%
                  nucleotide identity over 200bp, cross-interference is likely. Wormbase Gene Summary pages give information on which gene(s)
                  an RNAi clone is likely to target.

               <p>Many investigators purify their dsRNA prior to injection, either by ethanol precipitation or using an RNA purification kit.
                  However, we obtain equivalent RNAi injection results with purified and unpurified dsRNA. For RNAi by soaking, purification
                  is necessary to prevent death during the soaking process.
               </p>
               <p><span class="underline">Note 2:</span></p>
               <p>In general, equivalent results are seen irrespective of the site of injection, but some RNAi phenotypes might be stronger
                  after a gonad injection. For example, progeny might inherit more dsRNA with a gonad injection, which might be helpful if the
                  gene is active in mid-embryogenesis. This can be tested empirically for your gene. If the needle clogs during injection, try
                  diluting the dsRNA a further 2X or more. Strong RNAi effects are seen by injection at quite low dsRNA concentrations (e.g.,
                  50 ng/ul). However, mixing dsRNAs together can significantly reduce the RNAi effect for a given gene (see Table 1 in <a href="#bib11">Gonczy et al., 2000</a>). Therefore, it is important to use care in experiments where two or more genes are to be inhibited simultaneously by RNAi
                  (e.g., use antibodies to confirm that the knockdowns have been successful).

               <p>Typically, 24 hours post-injection is a good starting point for a good RNAi effect. For many genes, the strength and penetrance
                  of RNAi phenotypes are increased in progeny laid more than 24 hours post-injection, especially for genes with a strong maternal
                  contribution. It is a good idea to do a time course to find the optimum time of scoring post-injection, looking for a time
                  when the phenotype is strongest and most penetrant. For some genes, shorter times post-injection will give a stronger effect,
                  particularly for genes with a zygotic but not a maternal function. If antibodies are available, it can be helpful to stain
                  progeny at different times post-injection to see when the protein is maximally reduced. In order to maintain progeny production
                  at later time points, mate the injected hermaphrodites with N2 males after injection. Using an RNAi supersensitive strain
                  can increase the strength and penetrance of phenotypes. <span class="emphasis"><em><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=rrf-3" target="_blank">rrf-3</a></em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=eri-1" target="_blank">eri-1</a></em></span> both display sterility at 25&deg;C and smaller broods than N2 at lower temperatures (<a href="#bib15">Simmer et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#bib13">Kennedy et al., 2004</a>), but this can be overcome by mating with N2 males after injection, as they are cross fertile at all temperatures (J.

                           RNAi might be lower than that of single RNAi for each gene, protein or mRNA levels for each gene should be assessed whenever

Because these background
                           phenotypes tend to be enhanced by the soaking process, be cautious about interpreting results when these strains are used.

               <p>This part of the protocol will differ slightly depending on your assay. After feeding, either the aliquoted worms or their
                  progeny can be scored. For some assays, scoring is easier if progeny are synchronized. In this case, fed gravid mothers are
                  allowed to lay eggs on a new plate, then removed, and the progeny subsequently scored. This step is time consuming and not
                  always necessary.

                     from weak to strong. This can be helpful if screening for post-embryonic phenotypes, where a strong knockdown might cause
                     embryonic lethality. Low percentage embryonic lethality is difficult to score using this method.

                  <p>L1s can be used instead of L4s in either of the above protocols. An advantage of using L1s is that some phenotypes can be
                     scored in the fed worms instead of the progeny, allowing an easily scored synchronized population to be used. However for
                     some genes, inherited maternal product will be sufficient for gene activity, preventing induction of a phenotype in the fed
                     worms. Also, as many genes are required at multiple times in development, different phenotypes may be seen when using L1s
                     compared to L4s. For example, RNAi of some genes induces sterility of the fed L1s whereas L4 feeding induces embryonic lethality
                     of the progeny. This will preclude scoring of progeny for these genes if L1s are fed. In contrast, using L1s is beneficial
                     if the assay is for any form of lethality (e.g., sterility, larval lethality, or embryonic lethality).
                  </p>
                  <p>Notes: Aliquoting bleached embryos directly onto feeding plates instead of hatching them into starved L1s first is not recommended
                     because it is more difficult to aliquot the same number of animals/well due to embryos sticking together. Also, variable hatching
                     rates between bleached preparations will cause inter-experiment variation.

                  only one gene may be significantly inhibited, or both genes may be only slightly knocked down. Controls should be carried
                  out to test for knockdown of each gene.

            <p>RNAi feeding in liquid is a good method to use when the assay is growth or lack of growth. High embryonic lethality, sterility,
               larval lethality, and severe slow growth phenotypes are easy to score in liquid culture. Scoring a population for a large
               change in expression of a GFP reporter can also be done in liquid culture. Screening for post-embryonic phenotypes or low
               percentage lethality (e.g., under 30%) is better done using RNAi by feeding on plates.

                  of spinning the bacteria down and resuspending in S-Basal. In our hands, this has variable success. There is a higher incidence
                  of contamination and bacteria continue to grow, making scoring more difficult, as the wells do not clear. We find that removing
                  the LB and resuspending the bacteria in S-Basal produces more reproducible and easier to score results.

               <p>Note 2: Feeding of different larval stages may give different results. For example, many genes that induce an embryonic lethal
                  RNAi phenotype from an L4 feeding induce sterility with L1 feeding. Which stage or stages to use will depend on the assay
                  and your specific phenotype and should be determined empirically using controls.
               </p>
               <p>Note 3: If you want to use a larger volume of media per well (e.g., 150 &#956;l), the plates will need to be shaken for aeration
                  or worms may die due to lack of oxygen.

               <p>It is possible to carry out a liquid culture screen feeding two bacterial strains at once. For example, one common bacterial
                  strain can be mixed with each individual strain to look for interacting genes. The bacteria should be grown separately, mixed
                  in equal amounts, then spun down and resuspended in S-basal feeding buffer as above, or else prepared completely separately
                  before mixing. In most cases, the use of an RNAi supersensitive strain is necessary for the success of feeding two RNAi bacterial
                  strains together (S. Woods, D. Rivers, and J. Ahringer, unpublished; A Fraser, pers. comm.).

                  <p>This gene knockout strategy uses a random mutagen, trimethylpsoralen (psoralen) to mutagenize a very large number of worms.
                     The worms are divided into many small subcultures and allowed to have progeny. A portion of each subculture is stored alive
                     in the freezer, and genomic DNA is made from the rest of the culture. This DNA is thus made from the siblings of the frozen
                     worms and carries the same mutations as the frozen worms carry. At a very low frequency (~1/200,000 mutagenized genomes) the
                     mutagenesis will produce a small deletion (100-1000 bp) in any gene of interest. If PCR primers flanking an area of the gene
                     of interest are used to amplify from the genomic DNA samples, deletions between the primers can be detected since they will
                     bring the primer sites closer together and thus will generate a PCR amplicon smaller in size than that amplified from wild-type
                     genomic DNA. When the PCR reaction is carried out under appropriate conditions, smaller deletion amplicons are amplified much
                     more efficiently than the larger wild-type amplicon. Thus DNA representing several thousand mutagenized genomes can be amplified
                     in a single reaction and a deletion amplicon generated from just one of those genomes will still be detected on an ethidium
                     bromide-stained agarose gel. Once a DNA pool containing a deletion is identified, one can work back to identify the subculture
                     of worms in which the deletion occurred. The frozen worms from that subculture are thawed, and individual live animals carrying
                     the deletion mutation can be identified. It is important to note that deletion mutations are detected and recovered in heterozygous
                     form, so recessive mutations that cause lethality or sterility are not selected against and can easily be obtained.
                  </p>
                  <p>A standard mutant library consists of psoralen-UV mutagenized worms representing about 920,000 haploid genomes. Twenty F1
                     progeny of mutagenized worms are cultured and allowed to have F2 progeny in each well of 240 96-well microtiter plates. Half
                     of each culture is frozen (generating a 240 microtiter plate frozen library of live animals), 1/4 of each culture is used
                     to generate genomic DNA preps from pools of 96 wells: these pooled DNA preps are used as PCR templates for first level screening.
                     The remaining 1/4 of each culture is lysed in the original culture well and frozen for use as PCR templates in second level
                     screening (generating a second set of 240 plates that must be stored in a freezer). 240 microtiter plates fit on one shelf
                     of a standard -80 degree freezer, so two freezer shelves are required to store the library.

                  <p>This procedure requires an initial investment of about two weeks of part-time work to pilot the methods followed by ~three
                     weeks of full-time work (if two individuals work together) to construct a frozen mutant library. The library can be stored
                     indefinitely and can be screened at least 400 times. Once the library is constructed one can isolate a live mutant in a gene
                     of interest in only 2&#8211;3 weeks of work.
                  </p>
                  <p>We suggest that no more than two people should do the actual work of library construction. Spreading the work among a larger
                     number of people may sound appealing, but the amount of work involved is not so much that more than two people are needed,
                     and a larger group can be detrimental to quality control. We also suggest that at least one of the individuals constructing
                     a deletion library should have several years of bench experience. These protocols are written based on the assumption that
                     the reader has some familiarity with <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> and standard worm culture methods. If you have no experience with <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> we do not recommend you attempt this method without help.
                  </p>
                  <p>The time, manpower, space, and financial resources required to use this procedure are modest enough that this technology is
                     suitable for even a small laboratory that needs to generate several knockout mutations in several genes. However, we do not
                     recommend it for labs that only need to knockout a single or just a few genes. For such laboratories, requests can be made
                     to two <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> gene knockout consortiums. Information about such knockout requests can be found online at: <a href="http://celeganskoconsortium.omrf.org/" target="_top">http://celeganskoconsortium.omrf.org/</a> or <a href="http://shigen.lab.nig.ac.jp/c.elegans/index.jsp" target="_top">http://shigen.lab.nig.ac.jp/c.elegans/ index.jsp</a>.

                  <p>A key feature of these protocols is that they include quantitative quality control assessments at each stage of library construction.
                     Thus the success of each part of the procedure can be verified along the way, and any unsuccessful batches can be discarded
                     immediately if a failure occurs. The production of a successful deletion library can be essentially guaranteed as long as
                     the individuals constructing the library are committed to meeting all the quality control criteria. Every failure we are aware
                     of resulted from individuals failing to take the quality control targets seriously and forging ahead without meeting them.
                  </p>
                  <p>A standard 920,000 mutagenized genome library is adequate to identify at least one deletion allele in most genes. The size
                     of the library can easily be increased to improve the success rate and average number of alleles obtained per gene. At Yale
                     we have two mutant libraries representing a total of about two million genomes. Since completing the second library, we have
                     succeeded in isolating at least one deletion mutation for every gene we have attempted to knock out. Two publications that
                     contain examples of using this technology to knock out whole families of genes are <a href="#bib3">Hess et al. (2004)</a> and <a href="#bib1">Chase et al. (2004)</a>.

                  <p>These protocols are based on methods originally developed and described previously by three different groups: 1) Bob Barstead's
                     lab at the Oklahoma Medical Research Center (<a href="#bib2">Edgley et al., 2002</a>); 2) the NemaPharm Group at Axys Pharmaceuticals (<a href="#bib6">Liu et al., 1999</a>); and 3) Ron Plasterk's lab at the Netherlands Cancer Institute (<a href="#bib4">Jansen et al., 1997</a>; <a href="#bib5">Jansen et al., 1999</a>). The library construction methods described here are most similar to those originated at NemaPharm, and include the microtiter
                     culture/frozen worm strategy pioneered there. Rajesh Ranganathan and Peter Reddien in the Horvitz lab developed the special
                     container used to freeze worms in microtiter plates. The library screening protocols are based on the &#8220;poison primer&#8221; method
                     described in <a href="#bib2">Edgley et al. (2002)</a>. Most aspects of the procedure have been varied to improve efficiency and success rate. Thus, these methods differ from those
                     of others in a number of details.

                                 processing the grown cultures. Processing involves 1) producing a set of 24 microtiter plates of frozen worms, stored at -80&deg;C;
                                 2) producing a corresponding set of 24 &#8220;single well lysates&#8221; that can be used as PCR templates, also stored at <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>80&deg;C; and 3) producing 24 &#8220;pooled DNA&#8221; preps, one for each plate, that are also used as PCR templates.

                                 steps work before beginning full-scale production. Proceed to full-scale production by setting up five batches, one per day
                                 for five days, and then spending five days harvesting those batches, one per day. Repeat this procedure once more to produce
                                 enough batches for a complete library. At the end, complete the processing of the pooled DNA preps for all the batches. This
                                 schedule distributes the work over a three-week period in a fairly even fashion.

                     <p>Psoralen-UV mutagenesis is less used and somewhat more difficult than <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=EMS;class=Cell" target="_blank">EMS</a> mutagenesis, which is the standard method for most <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> genetics. However, psoralen-UV mutagenesis is thought to produce a higher frequency of the class of small deletions detected
                        by the deletion screening methods described below.
                     </p>
                     <p>Animals should be mutagenized at the late L4 stage. Use a dissecting microscope to verify the staging: almost all the animals
                        should have a white crescent visible where the vulva is undergoing morphogenesis; a few will be just past this stage. This
                        should be at about 43&#8211;48 hours after they were put on plates with food. The animals should be almost perfectly synchronous.
                     </p>
                     <p>Keep all solutions of psoralen and worms treated with psoralen in the dark; ordinary room light has ~3-4 &#956;W/cm<sup>2</sup> of 360 nm UV light.

                              <p>Pour the worms into a 15 cm sterile plastic petri dish. Use a UV dose meter to monitor the 360 nm UV dose (through a petri
                                 dish bottom) on the UV box. For example, if the machine gives an intensity of 3.05&#8211;3.2 mW/cm2, expose the worms for ~7&#8211;8 seconds.
                                 Quickly place the petri dish at the center of the machine, time the 7&#8211;8 seconds, and remove the dish. Afterward transfer the
                                 worms with a Pasteur pipette back to a 15 ml tube and spin down in a clinical centrifuge. Remove the supernatant to a psoralen
                                 liquid waste container. Wash the worms twice in ~5 mls of M9. Remove all of the last supernatant except for ~200 &#956;l. Using
                                 a sterile glass pipette, transfer the worms to the edge of the bacterial lawn on 15 cm NGM plates. Eight 15 cm plates should
                                 suffice to give enough food to allow the worms to grow to gravid adults. Place plates at 25&deg;C in the dark.

                              <p>This is a very heavy mutagenesis and results in significant lethality of the F1 progeny of the mutagenized animals. Raising
                                 the UV dose even slightly leads to a rapid increase in the F1 lethality, so the UV dose must be monitored and controlled carefully.
                                 The best way to monitor the mutagenesis is to measure the F1 lethality and adjust the UV dose until you reach the desired
                                 range of 10&#8211;15% lethality, as described below.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>A more convenient way to carry out the psoralen mutagenesis is as follows. After the 15 minute incubation in psoralen solution,
                                 spin down the worms and remove the supernatant. Transfer the animals in a small amount of liquid to the surface of unseeded
                                 NGM plates. Place the plates in a &#8220;Stratalinker&#8221; (Stratagene) equipped with long-wave (360 nm) UV bulbs (note that the standard
                                 bulbs in these machines are for short-wave UV). The Stratalinker can then be used to deliver a measured dose of UV radiation.
                                 While this method has been very successful for psoralen mutagenesis for other purposes, it has not been used to generate a
                                 deletion library and thus this method of mutagenesis cannot be guaranteed to work for library production.

                        The plates should be recently starved, there should be lots of F1 L1's on the plate, and the P0 adults should be bloated with
                        unlaid eggs.
                     </p>
                     <p>To assess the success of mutagenesis, remove ~20 worms to a freshly-seeded plate at 25&deg;C for a few hours, remove the adults,
                        and then replace the plates at 25&deg;C overnight. The next day count the number of hatched larvae and dead eggs among the F1.
                        The mutagenesis worked well if there is ~10&#8211;15% lethality in the F1's. This is the first quantitative quality control criterion

                        earlier. Plate the surviving eggs on two <span class="underline">unseeded</span> 6 cm NGM plates. The hatched eggs will arrest as starved and perfectly synchronized L1's that will then be ready to transfer

                     <p>An alternative method of getting gravid adults bloated with eggs prior to the second bleaching may be used to greatly increase
                        the yield of F2 animals. At 24&#8211;30 hours after the end of the mutagenesis, while the 15 cm plates are <span class="underline">not</span> close to starvation, wash off the worms with 5 mls of M9 per plate and transfer to a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Spin the worms
                        down, remove the supernatant, and wash twice with S medium, leaving 14 mls final volume. Pour the worms and S medium into
                        an empty, sterile 15 ml plastic petri dish (<span class="underline">not</span> filled with agar) and let sit on the lab bench for 4&#8211;5 hours. Shake the dish occasionally to keep the worms aerated, and
                        to avoid them sticking to the bottom of the dish. Inspect the culture periodically. When the worms appear bloated with eggs
                        (they do not lay eggs well in M9 medium) transfer the liquid to a 15 ml centrifuge tube, spin, remove the supernatant, and
                        bleach the eggs as stated in section 7.2.1.1 and above. Transfer the pellet of eggs to two unseeded plates. Add 10 mls of
                        S medium to the remaining empty petri dish, which will still have eggs stuck to its surface. Incubate the three petri dishes
                        overnight in the 25&deg;C incubator. This technique will produce reliable yields of about 80&#8211;100 thousand L1 animals.

                     <p><span class="bold"><strong>Commentary:</strong></span> The synchrony induced by starving the F1 animals is critical to the success of the procedure. It guarantees that an F1 animal
                        carrying a deletion mutation of interest will be the same age as the ~19 animals it is cultured with (see section 7.2.2).
                        If the animal of interest is younger than the others in the well it will have few F2 progeny and the deletion will therefore
                        be difficult to detect and recover.

                  <p>Use sterile technique when culturing the mutagenized worms. The growth medium contains an antibiotic/antimycotic to reduce
                     contamination. Visually inspect some of the plates for contamination when the cultures are harvested. Contaminated plates
                     must be discarded.
                  </p>
                  <p>The three critical parameters for growth in microtiter wells are 1) amount of bacteria added, 2) adequate aeration, and 3)
                     growth temperature. If too much bacteria is added the worms will die; if too little bacteria is added the worms will produce
                     few progeny before the culture starves. With the proper amount of food, 1000&#8211;2000 progeny will be obtained from the 20 worms
                     added to each microtiter well, and these progeny will starve as L1, L2, and L3 larvae 4&#8211;5 days after the culture is started.
                     Inadequate aeration causes the cultures to grow slowly or not at all. Cultures grow slowly at temperatures below 20&deg;C or above
                     25&deg;C.

                     <p>An important quality-control check is carried out at the time of harvesting to ensure that culturing has gone well. One of
                        the 25 plates in the batch is used as a &#8220;test plate&#8221;. 20 &#956;l are withdrawn from each of four wells in the test plate (pipette
                        up/down several times first to get a uniform suspension of worms) and combined in a tube containing 320 &#956;l of S medium. Plate
                        10 &#956;l of the diluted sample (again, removed after mixing well) on an unseeded NGM plate. Count the number of F2 larvae under
                        a dissecting scope to calculate the average number of F2 worms per &#956;l of culture. Repeat this measurement several times in
                        each early batch to feel confident that it is calculated accurately. Try to obtain &gt;1500 per well. Less than 1000 is absolutely
                        unacceptable. Record the number of worms calculated per well for each batch. When piloting and in early batches, also use
                        a P200 pipetteman to withdraw all the liquid and thus measure the volume of liquid in several wells of the test plate. Some
                        evaporation may have occurred, but there should be at least 40 &#956;l left in each well. If not, increase the moisture added to
                        the wet paper towels in the Tupperware container used for culturing.
                     </p>
                     <p>It is critical to the success of the overall procedure that the culturing go as well as possible&#8211;this is the major factor
                        affecting the reliability of recovering mutant animals. It is best if all cultures have &gt;1500 F2 animals per well. When the
                        number of F2 per well goes much below this, most of the F2 animals do not run out of food and arrest their development until
                        after they are past the L1 stage. Because these older animals do not survive freezing well, the relatively few live animals
                        recovered from thawing a positive culture may not be sufficient to guarantee that a live animal carrying the deletion of interest
                        will be recovered.
                     </p>
                     <p>Before scaling up to production level batches of 24 plates, run pilot worm cultures to make sure the target of 1500 starved
                        L1 F2 animals per well is being met or exceeded. During the piloting, ensure that 20 F1 animals are placed in each well. Also,
                        try culturing worms by varying the concentration of bacteria up and down within a two-fold range. It is critical to empirically
                        optimize the culturing step, and also to empirically determine that the target of 1500 F2 per well is met. Please note that
                        psoralen-mutagenized animals grow very differently from non-mutagenized animals. It is thus critical to optimize growth conditions
                        using animals mutagenized with psoralen following the same procedure as will be used for the library. This will also provide
                        an opportunity to optimize the UV dose during psoralen mutagenesis.

                                 mutations. Each pool has a complexity of 4,000 mutagenized haploid genomes. For convenience, the pooled animals from each
                                 plate are frozen immediately after each batch of cultures has grown. Then, after growing all the batches, the DNA preps from

                        plate plus freezing solution should be nestled in the stack of 6 plates within each freezing container, as described below.
                        After overnight in the freezer, the PCR tubes are test-thawed to measure the viability after freezing for each styrofoam box.

                           an insulated container to slow the cooling rate. The container must be constructed exactly as described here and as diagramed
                           in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>. Exactly six plates must be included in each container as the plates themselves contribute to the proper heat capacity and
                           cooling rate. The cultures need to have grown well in order to get good viability. Only the cultures that have starved when
                           the F2 animals are predominantly L1 larvae will survive freezing well.

                           packaged with a gel-ice pack and one soft foam rubber block inside. Discard the gel-ice and save the foam rubber - two foam
                           rubber blocks are needed to construct the inner insulation for each styrofoam container. Also, as the foam rubber tends to
                           get torn with use (it is very brittle when frozen at <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>80&deg;C), it is necessary to have a supply of replacement foam rubber. Although the foam rubber shipped by New England Biolabs
                           works well, any other foam rubber of similar density and consistency seems to also work.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cut a foam block lengthwise in two. These pieces fit exactly into the top and bottom of the cooler, and will be above and
                           below the stack of six freezing plates placed inside. Cut a second foam block lengthwise into thirds. These pieces will fill
                           all the rest of the space inside the cooler. Two pieces fit along the two sides of the stack of plates. Cut the third piece
                           in half; one half fits in front of the stack, one behind. Finally, place other small pieces of foam in the unoccupied corners
                           of the cooler to fill the air spaces. See <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a> for a diagram of this assembly. Handle the plates carefully to avoid splashing the liquid worm suspensions onto the plate
                           sealing film. This could cause some worms to be lost when a well is later thawed from one of the plates.

                        <p>The stack of plates and foam assembly are held together with two rubber bands placed around the circumference of the foam
                           pieces. These serve the dual purpose of holding the corner pieces in place, and securing an airtight seal among the many pieces.
                           Close the cooler, and use about twelve rubber bands (or some sturdy tape) to hold it tightly shut. Place the cooler in the
                           <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>80&deg;C freezer.
                        </p>
                        <p>The next day, transfer the plates to a properly labeled plastic Tupperware box in the freezer. It is important to place the
                           plates in their final spot in the appropriate order, so that they don't have to be re-arranged later. Test thaw the loose
                           PCR tube: thaw the sample by holding it between your fingers, and pipette the liquid onto a seeded NGM plate, and after 24
                           hours in a 20&deg;C incubator, count the number of live animals. If fewer than 100 live worms survive the test thaw then the set
                           of six plates from the corresponding freezing container should be discarded. Survival of greater than 200 worms is the minimum
                           necessary to allow adequately reliable recovery of mutant animals. Good batches have more than 400 live worms from the test
                           thaw.

                                 a single sterile reservoir. Pipet up and down several times to resuspend the worms before removing the liquid from the wells.
                                 Reuse the same tips over and over, but rinse by pipetting up and down twice in a trough of water between each use of the tips
                                 for actual samples. Pasteur pipette the liquid from the reservoir to a 1.5 ml snap-cap Eppendorf tube, washing both the pipette
                                 and the reservoir in between each prep so they can be reused. Spin briefly at 3000 rpm to pellet the worms, and use an aspirator
                                 to remove as much of the supernatant as possible without losing worms. The total volume of worms in liquid needs to be reduced
                                 from &gt;3 mls in the reservoir to 1.5 mls in the Eppendorf tube, so repeat the spin and removal of the supernatant a couple
                                 of times. Label each tube with the number of the corresponding culture plate. Numbering the tubes without error is critical
                                 for success: errors will make it impossible to trace mutants initially identified by PCR.

                                 all the worms should be dissolved. If you do not have an incubator equipped with a rocker, shaking the tubes by hand a couple
                                 of times during the incubation works fine.

                                 scale. The yield of some of the preps can be checked by running a bit (3 &#956;l) on an ethidium bromide stained agarose gel and
                                 comparing to a larger, purer prep of genomic DNA of known concentration (determined by OD<sub>260</sub>). When things go well, it is possible to achieved yields of up to 15 &#956;g.

                        <p>A deletion mutation should be present at ~one part in 4000 of a pooled DNA prep. The templates for the primary PCR screens
                           consist of 5 &#956;l of 10-fold dilutions of the 4,000 genome pools. The total yield of the 4,000 genome DNA preps should be at
                           least 3.4 &#956;g in 200 &#956;l. Thus about 8.5 ng of genomic DNA is present in each PCR reaction, which is ~77,500 copies of the genome,
                           or about 20 copies of the mutant genome. This should be enough copies to ensure the mutant DNA can be amplified successfully.
                           This means the library can be screened 400 times before running out of DNA. If the yield of DNA is significantly higher than
                           3.4 &#956;g per prep, use a higher dilution of the DNA preps for the screening templates. This will allow the library to be screened
                           more than 400 times.

                        <p>Each template used for the primary PCR screens consists of a diluted pooled DNA prep prepared from a 96-well plate of cultured
                           mutagenized worms. These templates thus represent DNA from 4,000 mutagenized haploid genomes. Diluted 4,000 genome pooled
                           DNA preps are prepared in microtiter format in M&#956;TI PCR plates (VWR). These have conical bottoms and are convenient to pipette
                           from using 12 channel pipettors. 20 &#956;l of each 4,000 genome prep is diluted by adding 180 &#956;l of 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1 mM
                           EDTA. The M&#956;lti plate is placed in a microtiter format tray (pipette tip holder) for stability, covered with parafilm, and
                           stored at <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>80&deg;C. As there is a danger that such a plate might be dropped and the DNA lost, it is nice that only 10% of the total pooled
                           DNA preps are stored in any one such set of plates of diluted templates.

                           products, this arrangement causes the samples to be in the order 1,2,3, &#8230; after loading on the gel.

                  <p>Recent improvements have been made in the protocol for screening deletion libraries using procedures based on the &#8220;poison
                     primer&#8221; method (<a href="#bib2">Edgley et al., 2002</a>). This method is a dramatic improvement on earlier screening methods. Whereas earlier methods mainly detected larger (&gt;600
                     bp) deletions, the poison primer method allows more sensitive detection of smaller deletions. These smaller deletions appear
                     to occur more frequently in psoralen-mutagenized libraries than do larger deletions, so that the efficiency of detecting deletions
                     appears to be perhaps 2&#8211;3 fold better using the poison primer method (<a href="#bib2">Edgley et al., 2002</a>). However, the previous sentence understates how great an improvement the poison primer method is. Because it involves smaller
                     PCR amplicons that are amplified more reliably and reproducibly, the poison primer method dramatically reduces the time spent
                     optimizing PCR conditions and dealing with failed PCR reactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>The goal of the screening procedure is to identify pooled DNA samples that contain DNA from a deletion mutant for a gene of
                     interest. By PCR amplifying a region of the gene of interest and running the products on a gel, in principle the smaller deletion
                     amplicon will be observed on the gel as a band with faster mobility than the larger wild-type amplicon. However, deletion
                     mutant DNA is present at only 1 part in 4,000 in the pooled DNA sample, so the challenge is to increase the abundance of the
                     deletion amplicon to the point where it can be visualized on a gel.
                  </p>
                  <p>A template that has suffered an internal deletion has a small advantage over the wild-type template during each cycle of PCR
                     due to the shorter length of the deleted template. Suppose that the chance of completing an extension across a deleted template
                     is 10% better than for the wild type. After 35 cycles of amplification there will be a 28-fold enrichment of the deleted amplicon
                     relative to the wild-type amplicon. After 70 cycles the enrichment will be 790-fold. As can be seen from this example, a key
                     to detecting rare deletion mutations is to send the PCR through a very large number of productive cycles. Even if the PCR
                     machine is programmed to run through 70 cycles, if the amplification reactions run out of reagents and reach their endpoints
                     after only a small number of cycles, rare deletion amplicons will not be enriched sufficiently to detect them. The goal is
                     thus to set up PCR reactions under relatively inefficient conditions that will allow amplification to continue productively
                     for a full 70 cycles. The poison primer method, described below, is a simple way to do this.
                  </p>
                  <p>It is desirable to set up conditions such that wild-type template produces a nice clean single band on a gel without too much
                     smear or artifact bands that might obscure deletion amplicons. This seems to require doing two rounds of PCR using nested
                     primers, as sending a single primer pair through 70 cycles under inefficient amplification conditions tends to give messy
                     results in which artifactual amplicons can predominate. Even with nesting, multiple artifactual bands arise in the amplifications.
                     These artifactual bands may constitute an acceptable background as long as they are not too intense or too variable. Such
                     artifacts that occur reproducibly in amplifications from many or all pooled DNA templates can be discounted. The screener
                     is looking for rare events that occur reproducibly only when a particular pooled DNA sample is amplified.

                     <p>The poison primer method is a procedure for limiting the efficiency of amplification of the PCR product of interest in the
                        first of the two rounds of nested PCR (<a href="#bib2">Edgley et al., 2002</a>). Relatively little product is made in the first round of 35 cycles, and this limited product is then further diluted for
                        use as the template for the second round of amplification. So little template is thus added for amplification to the second
                        round that most of its 35 amplification cycles occur before the reaction reaches saturation. Therefore, a large portion of
                        the 70 cycles of PCR from the two rounds of amplification are productive and can thus help enrich for deletion amplicons.

                              <p>The poison products effectively suppresses amplification of the full-length outer amplicon during the first round because
                                 the poison amplicons are relatively short and thus efficiently amplified. By efficiently using up reagents in the amplification
                                 reaction, the poison products suppress production of other amplicons.

                              <p>The second round primers cannot reamplify the poison products, but can reamplify the first round outer amplicon and any deletion
                                 mutant amplicons. A gel run after the second round reaction thus shows only the large second round amplicon, plus any deletion
                                 amplicons. The poison products from the first round have been diluted below the threshold of detection.

                              <p>The poison primer method is the simplest and most effective method tried so far for detecting deletion amplicons. Other methods
                                 based on seemingly simpler or more logical designs have been extensively piloted and used, but the poison primer method is
                                 easily the winner based on empirical results. In addition to being the most effective screening method, it is also very simple
                                 and rapid.

                     <p>Design two sets of primers flanking the region of the gene in which you would like to obtain a deletion. An amplicon size
                        of 1 kb is easily amplified during PCR and seems sufficient in size to allow detection of deletions. Therefore, choose outer
                        primers that will amplify a region just larger than 1 kb and inner primers that will amplify a region of ~1 kb. Along with
                        the outer primer set, choose two poison primers that are roughly in the middle of the outer amplicon. Make one forward and
                        one reverse poison primer. These two poison primers should be near each other but not overlapping by more than one base pair
                        on their 5' ends. To select primer sets, follow a simple set of rules: 1) primers should be 22mers; 2) they should have 11
                        &plusmn; 1 G/C residues (since all <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> genomic DNA except for exons is very A/T rich, the primer sites will usually be placed in exons); 3) avoid having an A or
                        T as the 3' residue; 4) avoid sequences that could form strong hairpins. Also, it can be helpful to check that the 3'-most
                        five base pair sequence of the primers does not occur greater than once in the interval being amplified (which can lead to
                        non-specific priming and amplification).
                     </p>
                     <p>Here are some hints for choosing useful primer sets. Choose a region of the gene in which a small deletion will likely cause
                        a loss-of-function mutation (i.e. the 5' end of the gene or a region of the gene that contains few or small introns). Therefore,
                        decide where to put the poison primers first and then choose the outer primer sets to flank the poisons. Try to avoid encompassing
                        non-coding sequence or introns &gt;200 bp within the selected screening interval since a small deletion in that area could fall
                        entirely within the non-coding region and therefore be questionable as to whether it has caused any effect on gene expression
                        or function.
                     </p>
                     <p>In order to ensure that a deletion is recovered, several 1 kb intervals of the same gene can be screened in parallel. For
                        each interval to be screened, order a set of six primers (two outers, two poisons, two inners).

                                 which gave only weak amplification products. In some cases there is no amplification from certain primer pairs, which suggests

                                 band is clearly reduced in reactions b1, b2, and c relative to reactions a. If the outer amplicon is suppressed below the

                                 those conditions. Partial suppression of the amplicon, as shown in the gel for primer sets 1&#8211;3 is also acceptable (<a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a>).

                                 not of the particular primer sites chosen, and cannot be eliminated. As long as the artifactual smears or bands are lower
                                 in intensity than the predicted amplicons, go ahead with a screen and look for deletion amplicons while ignoring the artifacts.

                        </p>
                        <p>For 1 kb amplicons use a 30 second extension time, as indicated above. For amplicons greater than 1.2 kb use a 1 min. extension
                           time. Run out PCR products on a 2% agarose gel.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the products appear as extremely strong bands in the test reactions, reduce the extension time by ~5-10 seconds when screening
                           the library to decrease the amplification efficiency. The reactions should not be too efficient, as this indicates that they
                           may have reached their endpoints in a small number of cycles, and less productive amplification cycles would lead to less
                           enrichment of deletion amplicons. However, do not obsess on this point or spend time running additional test reactions with
                           different extension times. The whole beauty of the poison primer method is that it is relatively robust and thus allows screening
                           to move forward quickly without a long delay for optimizing conditions. Running extra rounds of optimization can actually
                           be detrimental: after too many amplifications of the same DNA there is the possibility of the lab/reagents/equipment becoming
                           contaminated by the amplicon being amplified, ruining your ability to do further amplifications of this DNA.

                  <p>For the second round reactions, the templates are an extremely small volume of liquid transferred from the first round reactions
                     using a &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; device (Boekel replicator) with 96 metal pins spaced to fit into each well of a microtiter plate. Store
                     the hedgehog in clean dH<sub>2</sub>0, dip in EtOH, flame to get rid of the EtOH, dip in the first round reactions, and then dip in the second round PCR premixes
                     to add the templates. Rinse the hedgehog extensively between uses in running water so as to prevent unwanted DNA from contaminating
                     future PCR reactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>Be careful during screening to be clean. Try to avoid contaminating pipettors and other bench items with the PCR amplicon.
                     After about 800 amplifications of the same gene the PCR reactions can start giving very smeary patterns on gels due to contamination.
                     If this happens the best remedy is to switch to a new set of primers outside of the original sets that gave rise to the contamination.

                  <p>Pour a 300 ml 2% agarose gel with two 50-well combs in the Owl Centipede gel box. All 96 second-round reactions, plus marker
                     lanes, can be loaded on a single gel. The high percentage agarose gel allows separation of bands that differ by only a small
                     amount. Some of the deletions identified using this poison method can be quite small (50 bp) and give rise to very low abundance
                     amplicons, so detecting them on a gel requires good separation and a good eye with willingness to look closely and carefully
                     at the gel for <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> band smaller than wild type. These products resulting from small deletions may run just under the wild-type product and can

                  <p>Loading these gels requires care and practice: generally the tips are initially placed in the wells at a shallow angle to
                     the gel, and then raised to near vertical before dispensing the samples. If care is not taken some tips will not be in the
                     appropriate wells. Run the gel at 110 volts for 90 min. in 1X TAE. The gel and running buffer should contain ethidium bromide
                     at 0.2 &#956;g/ml. A representative gel is shown in <a href="#figure7">Figure 7</a>.

                  <p>Recheck primary positives by reamplifying the appropriate diluted pooled DNA templates three times to see if the deletion
                     band reproduces at least twice. The extra frozen large aliquots of the PCR premixes may be used for this purpose. Typically
                     70&#8211;90% of the &#8220;positives&#8221; from the primary screen will not reproduce. Real positives will reproduce typically in all three
                     retries. Check that the deleted amplicons seen in the rescreen are the same size as the original positive. If a positive rechecks,
                     cut the deletion bands out of the gel, purify the DNA (Qiagen Qiaquick gel purification kit) and use this to restriction map
                     the deleted amplicon. (Alternatively, carry out a 100 &#956;l PCR amplification of the positive band using the inner primers to
                     get enough to restriction map the amplicon. These PCR products can be purified using a Qiagen Qiaquick PCR purification kit).
                     Restriction map the deletion by using ~5 enzymes that cut at unique sites spread across the amplicon and check to see which
                     enzymes cut (site not deleted) versus which enzymes do not cut (site deleted). If the restriction map shows that the amplicon
                     may carry a useful deletion (i.e. removes some coding sequence), send the purified PCR amplicon for sequencing to determine
                     the exact deletion sequence. On occasion, in addition to material being deleted, a short stretch of sequence is inserted at
                     the site of the deleted material.

                     <p>Place dry ice pellets and/or powder to fill up the lower ~1/4 of a styrofoam cooler. Place a flat piece of styrofoam on top
                        of the dry ice inside the cooler. Go to the <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>80&deg;C freezer and quickly remove the appropriate plate of frozen cultures and place it into the styrofoam container. Work quickly.
                        The idea is to remove the positive well while leaving all the other 95 wells in the plate nicely frozen and viable. Place
                        the plate upside down on the piece of styrofoam. Carefully identify the positive well. Using a brand-new razor blade mounted
                        in a &#8220;carton-cutter&#8221; handle (can be bought at drugstores/hardware stores), make a cut on all four sides of the positive well
                        as illustrated by the dashed lines in <a href="#figure8">Figure 8</a>. As shown, make the cuts more than long enough to be sure they will intersect so that the well will be cleanly removed. The
                        razor blade will cut deeply down into the underlying styrofoam which helps make sure the cut has gone all the way through
                        the soft plastic plate. Once the well is removed, immediately put the plate back in the <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>80&deg;C freezer in its proper position.

                     <p>Place the excised well, top up, between your fingers to thaw. When thawed, use a sterile yellow tip and a P200 pipettor to
                        distribute the liquid around the outside of the bacterial lawn on seeded NGM plates. Wash the empty well and the used pipette
                        tip with 50 &#956;l of M9 medium to recover any residual animals remaining. Every worm is potentially carrying the deletion of
                        interest and is therefore precious! Leave the plates right side up until the liquid is absorbed. Then culture the plates upside
                        down in a 20&deg;C incubator.

                     <p>As many live worms as possible must be recovered from the thaw. It is desirable to get more than 300 live animals from the
                        thaw as the mutant animals may be present at a frequency of 1/100 or less. Absolutely every animal must be removed from the

                        plates twice a day and pick off every single live L3 or L4 animal. Animals will thus be picked over a 2&#8211;3 day interval. Please
                        note that larvae recovering from a thaw are <span class="underline">much</span> more delicate than <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> larvae that have not been frozen, and therefore the warning not to pick L1 or L2 larvae must be taken seriously.

                        plastic box with a loose-fitting lid to maintain humidity, and incubated at 20&deg;C with no shaking. Label the plates to indicate

                  <p>Animals recovered from the deletion library have been heavily mutagenized and contain many mutations in addition to the deletion
                     of interest. Therefore, it is necessary to extensively backcross the recovered mutant to the wild type (at least 4&#8211;6 times)
                     to clean up the genetic background. During backcrossing, it is necessary to genotype many animals to determine whether they
                     carry the deletion of interest and whether they are homozygous or heterozygous for the deletion. The backcrossing process
                     is actually the slowest step in the procedure of obtaining a useful mutant. Described here is an efficient and rapid procedure
                     to get through the process.

                        <p>In the backcrossing procedure described below, sets of 8&#8211;16 adult hermaphrodite worms must be genotyped. These animals are
                           placed, one worm per tube, into PCR tubes containing a proteinase K solution, digested to release DNA, and then amplified
                           by PCR using primers specific to the gene of interest. Use &#8220;duplex&#8221; PCR reactions in which three primers are used to produce
                           two different-sized products that are simultaneously amplified, one that arises only from the wild-type allele, and one that
                           arises only from the deletion allele. Design the primers so that the amplicon from the wild-type allele is only 250&#8211;400 bp,
                           and the amplicon from the deletion allele is ~100 bp larger than the wild-type amplicon (<a href="#figure9">Figure 9</a>). The small size of the amplicons is necessary in order to get adequately efficient amplification from single-worm lysates.
                           The closeness in size of the two amplicons ensures that they compete with each other fairly equally for reagents during amplification.
                           Always make the wild-type amplicon smaller than the mutant amplicon since the smaller amplicon sometimes suppresses amplification
                           of the larger one, and it is absolutely necessary to correctly identify a worm as a mutant homozygote.

                              <p><b>Figure 9. Duplex PCR genotyping of single worms.&nbsp;</b>A set of three primers is chosen that will amplify a ~350 bp mutant amplicon and a ~250 bp wild-type amplicon from worms carrying
                                 a deletion in a gene of interest. The placement of the primers is diagramed in the upper schematic. After PCR using a mix
                                 containing the duplex primers, a 1% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel is run (lower schematic). The genotype of the worm
                                 in each tube is determined. A homozygous mutant animal (m/m) produces only the larger ~350 bp amplicon. A wild-type animal
                                 (+/+) produces only the lower ~250 bp amplicon. Animals heterozygous for the deletion (+/m) produce both the larger mutant
                                 and the smaller wild-type amplicons. For size verification of PCR amplicons, 1 kb DNA ladder is used (not shown).

                                 now been backcrossed 2X (actually the autosomes have been backcrossed 2X, and the X chromosome only 1X). To continue backcrossing,
                                 go immediately back to step &#8220;a&#8221; and repeat until sufficient backcrossing (4-6X) has been done.

                  <p>If you are not experienced with 12-channel pipettors, please note that you must generally use tips made by the same manufacturer
                     that made the pipettor. While this is not necessary for single-channel pipettors, the fit between pipettor and tip must be
                     more precise for 12-channel pipettors in order that they can both seal well when the tips are put on, and also release well
                     when the tips are ejected.
