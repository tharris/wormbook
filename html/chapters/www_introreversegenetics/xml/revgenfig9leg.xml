<title>Figure 9. Duplex PCR genotyping of single worms</title>
<para>A set of three primers is chosen that will amplify a ~350 bp mutant amplicon and a ~250 bp wild-type amplicon from worms carrying a deletion in a gene of interest. The placement of the primers is diagramed in the upper schematic. After PCR using a mix containing the duplex primers, a 1&#x00025; ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel is run (lower schematic). The genotype of the worm in each tube is determined. A homozygous mutant animal (m/m) produces only the larger ~350 bp amplicon. A wild-type animal (&#x0002B;/&#x0002B;) produces only the lower ~250 bp amplicon. Animals heterozygous for the deletion (+/m) produce both the larger mutant and the smaller wild-type amplicons. For size verification of PCR amplicons, 1 kb DNA ladder is used (not shown).</para>
