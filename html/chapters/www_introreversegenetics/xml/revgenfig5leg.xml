<title>Figure 5. Schematic of primers and amplicons in the poison primer method</title>
<para>Two rounds of nested PCR amplifications are used in which one or two poison primers are added to the first-round PCR mix (top schematic). In the first round reaction, full-length and poison amplicons are produced (middle schematic). During the second round of amplification in which the poison primers are not added, the wild-type and deletion amplicons are produced (lower schematic). Addition of the poison primers in the first round reaction reduces the amount of full-length amplicon produced, thereby allowing the slightly smaller deleted amplicons to outcompete the amplification of the wild-type amplicon in the second round of PCR.</para>
