<title>Figure 8. Thawing a frozen culture</title>
<para>Schematic of a 96-well flexible freezing plate. After identifying the single well lysate that contains a deletion, the well containing the corresponding live animals is thawed. Being careful not to thaw the rest of the plate, use a razor blade to cut deeply through the plastic plate and sealing film in an overlapping pattern (dotted lines) that completely separates the well of interest from the plate. Remove and thaw the well and replace the plate back in its proper position in the <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x02212;</symbol>80&#x00B0; C freezer.</para>
