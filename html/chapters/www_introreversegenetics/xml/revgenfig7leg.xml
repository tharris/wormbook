<para>Second-round reactions from a 96-well plate are shown. The wild-type &#x007E;1 kb amplicon can be seen in all lanes except for a few in which the reactions failed. A small number of lanes also have smaller amplicons that represent potential deletion mutations; these are referred to as &#x0201C;primary positives&#x0201D;. A close look reveals some faint bands that occur reproducibly in many lanes; these are artifacts and should be ignored. Faint bands of a size that occurs in only one or a few lanes, however, should be treated as primary positives. For size verification of PCR amplicons 1 kb DNA ladder is used.</para>
