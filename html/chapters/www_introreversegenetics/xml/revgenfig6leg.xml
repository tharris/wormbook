<title>Figure 6. Empirically checking that the primers work</title>
<para>Ethidium bromide-stained 2&#x00025; agarose gel showing the amplicons produced after running test PCR reactions with primers chosen to amplify four 1 kb intervals of one gene of interest. Four sets of outer oligos (Primer sets 1-4) are shown at left. For each primer set, five different test amplifications are done in duplicate: outer primers only (a), outer primers with poison primer 1 (b1), outer primers with poison primer 2 (b2), and the outer primers with both poison primers (c). The inner oligos are also tested in duplicate for each primer set and the inner oligo products are shown at right (d). For size verification of PCR amplicons, 1 kb DNA ladder is used. Use primer sets in which the outer and inner oligos amplify a single amplicon. Use either one or both of the poison oligos if they also produce a single amplicon.</para>
