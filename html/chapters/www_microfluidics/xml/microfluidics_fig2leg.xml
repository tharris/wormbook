<para>Worms that enter a channel increase its fluidic resistance, thus directing the next worms to adjacent channels. A) Microfluidic device with branched network of channels for imaging in worm clamps. Black lines represent channels for worm loading.

B) Microfluidic device for parallel imaging of worms under light stimulation. Worms are studied in channels; area to the right is an unloading chamber. Scale bar is 250 &micro;m (<link linkend="bib49">Stirman et al., 2010</link><!-- PMID: 20538016-->) <emphasis>Reprinted with permission from Elsevier</emphasis>.</para>
