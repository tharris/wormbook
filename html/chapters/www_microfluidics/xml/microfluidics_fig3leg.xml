<para>A) Physical immobilization: compression of a membrane deflected by pressure in the control channel. The yellow layer represents a PDMS layer containing the channel for worm imaging. The green layer is a second PDMS layer on top of the worm imaging with an air-filled channel that when pressurized deflects the PDMS membrane for worm immobilization. The bottom white represents a glass slide.(<link linkend="bib11">Chokshi et al., 2009</link><!-- PMID: 19209348-->) <emphasis>Reproduced by permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry</emphasis>. B) Chemical immobilization: CO<subscript>2</subscript> diffusion through adjacent channel (<link linkend="bib11">Chokshi et al., 2009</link><!-- PMID: 19209348-->) <emphasis>Reproduced by permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry</emphasis>. C) Physical restriction in worm clamp, top view of device design.

D) Physical constraint gel, worm is immobilized by gelation of surrounding fluid at physiological temperatures; scale bar is 60 &micro;m (<link linkend="bib32">Krajniak and Lu, 2010</link><!-- PMID: 20461264-->) <emphasis>Reproduced by permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry</emphasis>. E) Cooling. Top: top view of a high-throughput imaging and sorting device that applies flow of a cooling fluid in a channel (blue) on top of the worm imaging channel (red). Green channels show valves to stop flow and worms; scale bar is 100 &micro;m (<link linkend="bib18">Chung et al., 2008</link><!-- PMID: 18568029-->) <emphasis>Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature Methods, copyright 2008.</emphasis> Bottom shows a side view of the same device with green valves closed.</para>
