<para>A) An example of a PDMS microfluidic device bonded to a glass slide, where worms are imaged in a fluid-filled channel. Access ports allow fluid exchange, worm entry and exit. Worms in imaging devices are typically immobilized by a variety of methods (Section 2.2). B) An example of a PDMS microfluidic device on top of an agar surface to study crawling worms&rsquo; behavior in gas-filled chambers. Access ports allow gas exchange for stimuli input and controlled gaseous concentrations. Scale bars are &sim; 1 cm to show typical chip dimensions. C) A microfluidic chip for <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> imaging and sorting experiments showing connections to inlet and outlet lines with syringe needle pins and polyethylene tubing.</para>
