        <title>Figure 1. Example of microarray hybridization</title>
        <para>A representative portion of a microarray shows the differential signals from two RNA
            samples. One RNA sample was reverse transcribed into cDNAs labelled with red
            fluorophore, the other RNA sample into cDNAs labelled with green fluorophore, and the
            cDNA mixture was hybridized to spots of DNA representing different genes. Selective
            hybridization of cDNA from either RNA sample to a DNA spot produces red or green signal;
            hybridization of cDNA from both RNA samples produces yellow signal. In this example, red
            spots represent RNAs enriched in hermaphrodites with wild type germ lines, and green
            spots are RNAs enriched in <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=glp-4" role="_blank">glp-4</ulink>(bn2)</emphasis> mutants with greatly diminished germ lines.</para>
