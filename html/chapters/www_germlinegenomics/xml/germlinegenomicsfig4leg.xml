        <title>Figure 4. Classification of germline-enriched gene sets based on predicted functions</title>
        <para>Using Gene Ontology categories, the three sets of germline-enriched genes
            (spermatogenesis, oogenesis, and intrinsic), were categorized by predicted function of
            their encoded protein products. The oogenesis and intrinsic groups are composed of very
            similar proportions of similar types of proteins, while the spermatogenesis group is
            distinct. The bars represent the different classifications of nucleic acid binding
            proteins. Reprinted with permission from <link linkend="bib19">Reinke et al., 2004</link><!-- [PMID 14668411]-->.</para>
