        <title>Figure 2. A highly exaggerated schematic of the left-right relationship of the gonadal arms with the intestine</title>
	<para>A real image of the posterior arm is shown in the micrograph (lower right) of part of an L4 larva lying on its right side, such that left is towards you, and right is through the paper or computer screen. The posterior arm stands out in front of (to the left of, from the point of view of the worm) the highly vacuolated intestine. The gonadal arm is somewhat "transparent" with these optics, permitting some of the intestine to be seen through it. The corresponding region of the anterior arm is shown in the left micrograph. The highly refractile vesicles of the intestine completely obscure the gonadal arm behind (to the right of) it. A pair of coelomocytes that is located on an animal's left is also in view. This is not surprising, because the focal plane of the intestine in this view is left of the anterior arm of the gonad. With respect to the body at large, this pair of coelomocytes is present in the ventral part of the middle body, just anterior of the vulva.</para>
