        <title>Figure 3. The Ncl phenotype</title>
	<para>The top panels demonstrate enlarged nucleoli conferred by a recessive mutation in the <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=ncl-1" role="_blank">ncl-1</ulink></emphasis> gene. The images are from the central focal plane of the tail of a hermaphrodite, with the cells K.a, F, and B indicated. Each of the white lines ends at the boundary of a nucleus, which appears as a depression in these images. A nucleolus appears as a dome within the depression. In the top right panel, the same image is shown with the nucleoli overlaid with black ellipses and with white arrows demarcating an edge of the nucleus of either F or B. Although cell boundaries are often not apparent with Nomarski optics (recall that we are studying the positions of nuclei), the actual cell boundary of B is somewhat visible here and is therefore roughly outlined (except for rectal cuticle on the apical side of B). The normal nucleoli of these cells in a wild-type animal are shown in the lower panels. Note how much smaller the domes are-how much less area of each nucleus is occupied by the nucleolus.</para>
