        <para>Based on 18s RNA gene sequences, five different clades (I-V) have been defined.
            Branches that could not be assigned to one of these clades are grouped collectively and
            named here "PCM group" (for <emphasis role="underline">P</emphasis>lectida, <emphasis
            role="underline">C</emphasis>hromadorida, <emphasis
            role="underline">M</emphasis>onhysterida; <link linkend="bib27">Schierenberg and Lahl, 2004</link>). With Nematoda as
            a phylum, four classes are defined by combining suggestions by <link linkend="bib19">Malakhov (1994)</link> and <link linkend="bib8">De
            Ley and Blaxter (2002)</link> because such a subdivision fits best our embryological data. Each
            genus mentioned in this chapter is indicated. Adapted from <link linkend="bib3">Blaxter et al. (1998)</link>.</para>
