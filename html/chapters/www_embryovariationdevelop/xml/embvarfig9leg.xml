        <title>Figure 9. Variations in gastrulation</title>
        <para>a, <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. Both descendants of the E cell (gut founder) have moved into the
            interior of the embryo after the 24-cell stage, only rudimentary blastocoel present. b,
            <emphasis>Plectus</emphasis> sp. (ES 601). The E cell has moved inside the embryo after the 12-cell stage. c,
            <emphasis>Enoplus brevis</emphasis>, 16-cell stage, two gut precursor cells have started to immigrate. D,
            same embryo as in c, ca. 64-cell stage, through the blastopore part of the immigrated
            gut precursors are visible. e, <emphasis>Tobrilus diversipapillatus</emphasis>. After the 64-cell stage gut
            precursors have started to move into the large blastocoel (bc) from the anterior region.
            f, same embryo as in e, most of the blastocoel is filled with immigrated cells. Between
            outer and inner cells a third layer has formed. Color code, blue, blastocoel; red, gut
            precursor cells (endoderm; in d, probably including pharyngeal precursors); green,
            intermediate layer (&#x0201C;mesoderm&#x0201D;). Orientation: anterior, left. Bars, 10 Âµm.</para>
