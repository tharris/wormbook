        <para>a-c, <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. a, With the first division a larger somatic cell
            <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=AB;class=Cell" role="_blank">AB</ulink> (left) and a smaller germline cell <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P1;class=Cell" role="_blank">P<subscript>1</subscript></ulink> (right) are generated; b, 4-cell stage, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=AB;class=Cell" role="_blank">AB</ulink> has
            divided symmetrically with transverse spindle orientation, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P1;class=Cell" role="_blank">P<subscript>1</subscript></ulink> has divided asymmetrically
            with longitudinal spindle orientation; c, 8-cell stage, germline cell <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P2;class=Cell" role="_blank">P<subscript>2</subscript></ulink> has divided
            asymmetrically; <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x2217;</symbol>, germline cells. d-f,
                <emphasis>Trichuris muris</emphasis>. d, 2-cell stage, an extremely asymmetric first
            cleavage has generated a smaller anterior and a larger posterior cell; e, 4-cell stage,
            both daughters have performed a symmetric division; f, 8-cell stage, no prominent
            asymmetric division has occurred. g-i, <emphasis>Prionchulus</emphasis> sp.; g, 2-cell
            stage resulting from a symmetric first cleavage; h, 4-cell stage, both daughter cells
            have divided symmetrically with transverse spindle orientation; i, 8-cell stage, one
            cell has performed a germline-like asymmetric division. j-l, <emphasis>Enoplus
            brevis</emphasis>, absence of early, asymmetric divisions giving no indication for the
            presence of a germ line; epi-illumination used because embryos are not transparent.
            Connecting lines, selected sister cells. Orientation: a-i, anterior, left. Scale bars:
