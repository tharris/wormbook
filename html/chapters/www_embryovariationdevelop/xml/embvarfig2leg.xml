        <para>Epifluorescence visualizing DAPI-stained nuclei. a, <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, 1-cell embryo prior to
            fusion of pronuclei; two PBs have been extruded at the anterior pole as the result of
            two consecutive meiotic divisions; b, <emphasis>D. coronatus</emphasis>, 2-cell stage, one PB present;
            insert: 2-cell embryo after division of the single PB; c, <emphasis>A. nanus</emphasis>, 3-cell stage, one PB
            present; d, <emphasis>Plectus</emphasis> sp. (ES 601) 1-cell stage with two PBs produced in two meiotic
            divisions. Scale bar, 10 <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x03BC;</symbol>m.
