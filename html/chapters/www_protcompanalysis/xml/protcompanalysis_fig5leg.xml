<para>Computational comparison of CoIP results for identification of candidate binding partners for biological follow-up. Venn diagrams of identified proteins from triplicate analysis of N2 and negative control CoIPs considering proteins identified in (A) only one replicate, (B) all three replicates, and (C) with statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) based on spectral counts and replicate frequency. *Denotes the location of the POI in the Venn diagram. Colored numbers indicate either the number of known binding partners (blue) or potential binding partners (green). (D) Comparison of the abundance fold-change in proteins based on spectral count ratio and statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) of the fold-change by dividing N2 protein spectral counts by negative control protein spectral counts. A value of 1 is used for proteins not present in either sample with no spectral counts. Proteins with the highest positive fold-change are the POI (magenta), known binding partners (blue), and potential binding partners (green) above background binding partners (black). (E) Comparison of identified protein confidence values from <emphasis>CompPASS</emphasis>. Protein confidence scores from negative control runs are subtracted from N2 protein confidence scores. The POI (magenta) and known binding partners (blue) cluster in the upper right portion of the graph to reveal potential binding partners (green) over background binding partners (black).</para>
