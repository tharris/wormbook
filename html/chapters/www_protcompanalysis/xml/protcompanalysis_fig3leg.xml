<para>A: Protein synthesized by ribosome; B: Protein modified and trafficked; C: Protein performing a function; D: Protein targeted for degradation.</para>

<para>An epitope can be purified from the time it is made (A) to the time it is degraded (D). Although the researcher may only be interested in functional binding partners and complexes (C), other &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; proteins and complexes (A, B, D) will also be purified and identified.</para>
