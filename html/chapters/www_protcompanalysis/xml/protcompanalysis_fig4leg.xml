<para>(A) Western blot analysis to track target POI<superscript>#</superscript>2 through the CoIP process. (B) Silver-stained gel analysis to track purification and abundance of the target POI<superscript>#</superscript>2 and binding partners through CoIP process. POI<superscript>#</superscript>2 silver-stained bands are marked based on the position in the Western blot. Protein spectral counts (SC) and sequence coverages (Seq Cov) for POI<superscript>#</superscript>2 are listed under each present or absent gel band to illustrate the relative detectability of POI<superscript>#</superscript>2 in the lysate (Lane 1), the CoIP with (Lane 7) and without (Lane 9) RNase treatment, and from the POI<superscript>#</superscript>2 negative control knock out strain (Lanes 2, 8, and 10). The gel lanes are the following: (1) N2 lysate, (2) Negative control lysate, (3) N2 CoIP supernatant, (4) Negative control CoIP supernatant, (5) N2 + RNAse treatment CoIP supernatant, (6) Negative control + RNase treatment CoIP supernatant, (7) N2 CoIP eluate, (8) Negative control CoIP eluate, (9) N2 + RNAse treatment CoIP eluate, and (10) Negative control + RNAse treatment CoIP eluate.</para>
