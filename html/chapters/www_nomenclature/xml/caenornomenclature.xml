<title>Introduction</title>
<para>Genetic nomenclature allows the genetic features of an organism to be structured and described in a uniform and systematic way. Genetic features, including genes, variations (both natural and induced), and gene products, are assigned descriptors that inform on the nature of the feature. These nomenclature designations facilitate communication among researchers (in publications, presentations, and databases) to advance understanding of the biology of the genetic feature and the experimental utilization of organisms that contain the genetic feature.</para>
<para>The nomenclature system that is used for <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> was first employed by <link linkend="bib1">Sydney Brenner (1974)</link><!--PMID: 4366476--> in his landmark description of the genetics of this model organism, and then substantially extended and modified in <link linkend="bib3">Horvitz et al., 1979</link><!--(PMID: 292825)-->. The gene, allele, and chromosome rearrangement nomenclature, described below, is an amalgamation of that from bacteria and yeast, with the rearrangement types from <emphasis role="italic">Drosophila</emphasis>. The nomenclature avoids standard words, subscripts, superscripts, and Greek letters and includes a hyphen (-) to separate the gene name from gene number (distinct genes with similar phenotypes or molecular properties). As described by <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/resources/person/WBPerson261#013542--10">Jonathan Hodgkin</ulink>, &lsquo;the hyphen is about 1 mm in length in printed text and therefore symbolizes the 1 mm long worm&rsquo;. These nomenclature properties make <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> publications highly suitable for informatic text mining, as there is minimal ambiguity. From the founding of the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (<ulink url="https://cgc.umn.edu/">CGC</ulink>) in 1979 until 1992, <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/resources/person/WBPerson521#013542--10">Don Riddle</ulink> and <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/resources/person/WBPerson154#013542--10">Mark Edgley</ulink> acted as the central repository for genetic nomenclature. <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/resources/person/WBPerson261#013542--10">Jonathan Hodgkin</ulink> was nomenclature czar from 1992 through 2013; this was a pivotal period with the elucidation of the genome sequence of <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>, and later that of related nematodes, and the inception of <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink>. Thus, under the guidance of <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/resources/person/WBPerson261#013542--10">Hodgkin</ulink>, the nomenclature system became a central feature of <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink> and the number and types of genetic features significantly expanded. The nomenclature system remains dynamic, with recent additions including guidelines related to genome engineering, and continued reliance on the community for input.</para>
<para><ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink> assigns specific identifying codes to each laboratory engaged in dedicated long-term genetic research on <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>. Each laboratory is assigned a laboratory/strain code for naming strains, and an allele code for naming genetic variation (e.g., mutations) and transgenes. These designations are assigned to the laboratory head/PI who is charged with supervising their organization in laboratory databases and their associated biological reagents that are described on <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink>, in publications, and distributed to the scientific community on request. The laboratory/strain code is used: a) to identify the originator of community-supplied information on WormBase, which, in addition to attribution, facilitates communication between the community/curators and the originator if an issue related to the information should arise at a later date; and b) to provide a tracking code for activities at the <ulink url="https://cgc.umn.edu/">CGC</ulink>. The laboratory/strain designation consists of 2-3 uppercase letters while the allele designation has 1-3 lowercase letters. The final letter of a laboratory code should not be an &ldquo;O&rdquo; or an &ldquo;I&rdquo; so as not to be mistaken for the numbers &ldquo;0&rdquo; or &ldquo;1&rdquo; respectively. Additionally, allele designations should also not end with the letter &ldquo;l&rdquo; which could also be mistaken for the number &ldquo;1.&rdquo; These codes are listed at the <ulink url="https://cgc.umn.edu/">CGC</ulink> and in <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink>. Investigators generating strains, alleles, transgenes, and/or defining genes require these designations and should apply for them at <ulink url="mailto:genenames@wormbase.org">genenames@wormbase.org</ulink>.</para>
<para>Information for several other nematode species, in addition to <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>, is curated at <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink>. All species are referred to by their Linnean binomial names (e.g,. <emphasis role="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</emphasis> or <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>). Details of all the genomes available at <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink> and the degree of their curation can be found at <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/species/all">www.wormbase.org/species/all</ulink></para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sec2">
<title>Genes</title>
<para>Three different gene naming schemes are employed in <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink>: GeneIDs, Sequence Names, and Gene Names.</para>
<para>First, for all genes <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink> has assigned a unique accession of the form &lsquo;WBGene#&rsquo;, for example &lsquo;WBGene00000024&rsquo;. The accession uniquely refers to a locus at a specific location in the genome: either a protein coding sequence (CDS) and transcript structure, an uncloned gene, a non-coding RNA transcript, a defined sequence element, or pseudogene. This accession follows the gene through any changes that may be made to it based on bioinformatics predictions or experimentation. If the gene object is split into two genes, the original accession will usually apply to the 5&rsquo; gene and a new accession will be assigned to the other half.</para>
<para>Second, for nearly all <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> genes <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink> has assigned a Sequence Name, which is derived from the cosmid, fosmid, or YAC clone on which they reside, and which was used to generate the reference Bristol <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" role="_blank">N2</ulink> genome sequence (The <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> <link linkend="bib4">Sequencing Consortium, 1998</link>)<!--: PMID: 9851916)-->. For example &lsquo;AC3.3&rsquo;, indicates that the gene is on cosmid <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=AC3;class=Clone" role="_blank">AC3</ulink>, and that there are at least 2 other genes (.1 and .2) on that cosmid.</para>
<para>Finally, for a number of loci, a standard genetic gene name is employed, which usually refers to mutant phenotype or some aspect of sequence similarity. Researchers who are investigating such genes are encouraged to propose gene names based on the guidelines in <link linkend="sec2.1">Section 2.1</link> and <link linkend="sec2.2">Section 2.2</link>. Genetic gene names consist of a three or four letter gene class name, e.g., &ldquo;<emphasis role="italic">abu</emphasis>&rdquo; (for <emphasis role="bold">A</emphasis>ctivated in <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis>locked <emphasis role="bold">U</emphasis>nfolded protein response), followed by a hyphen and a number: <emphasis role="italic">&ldquo;abu-1&rdquo;</emphasis>. A small number of gene objects defined by mutation are currently uncloned, and until associated with a sequence name will appear with just a standard genetic name. Publications commonly use the genetic name, as this designation provides information about function in biological processes, potential molecular function based on sequence similarity, or in some cases known biochemical activity. Sequence names for genes lacking a genetic name, of which there are many, are also used in publications, often with -omic level studies where functional information may be limited.</para>
<sect2 id="sec2.1">
<title>Applying for new gene class and/or gene names</title>
<para>Investigators wishing to propose new gene names for <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> should note the summary guidelines below and apply online via <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink> or by email application to <ulink url="mailto:genenames@wormbase.org">genenames@wormbase.org</ulink>. It is highly recommended that investigators contact <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink> with their gene name proposal prior to submission of a manuscript or abstract, as proposed gene names are not always used as the main name on <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink>. Reasons for not using a proposed name as the main name include the gene already having a name (usually being held in confidence; see <link linkend="sec2.2.8">Section 2.2.8</link>.) or that the name is inappropriate based on incorrect sequence analysis or other type of ambiguity.</para>

<title>Guidelines for proposing new gene names</title>
<sect3 id="sec2.2.1">
<title>&emsp;</title>
<para>Gene names must conform to the standard format of 3 or 4 letters gene class name, hyphen, number.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec2.2.2">
<title>&emsp;</title>
<para>Genes can be named on the basis of a mutant phenotype or on the basis of the predicted protein product or RNA product.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec2.2.3">
<title>&emsp;</title>
<para>For genes defined by mutation, the approved gene names refer to the mutant phenotype originally detected or most easily scored e.g., <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">dumpy</ulink> (<emphasis role="italic">d</emphasis>um<emphasis role="italic">py</emphasis>) in the case of <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00001067;class=Gene" role="_blank">dpy-5</ulink></emphasis>, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000062;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">lethal</ulink> (<emphasis role="italic">let</emphasis>hal) in the case of <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00002312;class=Gene" role="_blank">let-37</ulink></emphasis>.</para>

<sect3 id="sec2.2.5">
<title>&emsp;</title>
<para>Gene names based on homology with a previously named gene in another well-studied organism (e.g., <emphasis role="italic">Homo sapiens</emphasis>) or that is the standard in the relevant field (e.g., DNA replication) are often appropriate and desirable, especially where there is convincing orthology between genes (e.g., <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006944;class=Gene" role="_blank">wrn-1</ulink></emphasis> is the <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> ortholog of the human gene WRN1, responsible for Werner&apos;s syndrome, or <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00004393;class=Gene" role="_blank">rnt-1</ulink></emphasis> is the <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> ortholog of the <emphasis role="italic">Drosophila</emphasis> gene <emphasis role="italic">runt</emphasis>).</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec2.2.6">
<title>&emsp;</title>
<para>If a new gene clearly belongs in an existing gene class, then a new gene number will be assigned after consultation with the laboratory responsible for the gene class in question.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec2.2.7">
<title>&emsp;</title>
<para>If the establishment of a new gene class name seems more appropriate, then approval for this gene name must be obtained, preferably online via <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink> or by email application to <ulink url="mailto:genenames@wormbase.org">genenames@wormbase.org</ulink>. To avoid the situation of multiple names for the same gene in the literature, approval should be sought prior to abstract or manuscript submission.</para>

<para>Gene names including <emphasis role="italic">c</emphasis> (for <emphasis role="italic">Caenorhabditis</emphasis>), <emphasis role="italic">ce</emphasis> (for <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>), <emphasis role="italic">n</emphasis> (for nematode) or <emphasis role="italic">w</emphasis> (for worm) are discouraged. <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> as the organism of origin can be specified with a prefix (<emphasis role="italic">Cel</emphasis>-) if desired, e.g., <emphasis role="italic">Cel-fem-1</emphasis>.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec2.2.12">
<title>&emsp;</title>
<para>Gene names based solely on RNAi phenotypes or high-throughput analysis of gene expression or protein interactions are discouraged.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec2.2.13">
<title>&emsp;</title>
<para>A limited number of genes have been given temporary <emphasis role="italic">tag</emphasis>- names (<emphasis role="italic">tag</emphasis> = <emphasis role="italic">t</emphasis>emporarily <emphasis role="italic">a</emphasis>ssigned <emphasis role="italic">g</emphasis>ene name). These are genes for which deletion alleles have been generated by reverse genetic methods, but which have not yet been given more informative names based on sequence or mutant phenotype. When sufficient information becomes available, each <emphasis role="italic">tag</emphasis> name will be replaced by an appropriate standard 3- or 4-letter name.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec2.2.14">
<title>&emsp;</title>
<para>If a gene produces a protein that can be classified as a member of a family, the gene may also be assigned an approved name consisting of three or four italicized letters, a hyphen, and an italicized Arabic number, e.g., <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00003639;class=Gene" role="_blank">nhr-49</ulink></emphasis>, indicating that this is the 49th member of the <emphasis role="italic">nhr</emphasis> (nuclear hormone receptor) gene family.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec2.2.16">
<title>&emsp;</title>
<para>A limited number of genes, named on the basis of sequence homology, have been given non-standard names ending with alphanumeric identifiers rather than with simple numbers in order to make these names closer to the generally accepted names used in other organisms. For example, <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00001225;class=Gene" role="_blank">eif-3.B</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00001226;class=Gene" role="_blank">eif-3.C</ulink></emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00001227;class=Gene" role="_blank">eif-3.D</ulink>,</emphasis> etc. encode proteins of the conserved translation factor eIF3.</para>

<title>Approved gene name conflicts</title>
<para>Approved gene names that have been established in databases and have been used in a body of published literature should preferably not be changed.

The other names will continue to be listed in <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink>, where relevant associations can be found through search features. Whenever possible, name changes or the adoption of a single main name should be made with the approval of all laboratories concerned.</para>

<title>Guidelines for variation data</title>
<para>Variation is defined as a change in genome sequence compared to the reference <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> Bristol <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" role="_blank">N2</ulink> sequence. Variation can be experimentally induced (e.g., chemical mutagenesis, genome engineering) or found in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> strains isolated from natural environments. The term allele is applied both to experimentally-induced change and natural variation whether the change produces a phenotype or not. The term mutation is often applied to experimentally-induced variation which can often result in phenotypic deviation. The term polymorphism is applied to natural variation, and often does not result in a phenotype. The Bristol <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" role="_blank">N2</ulink> reference strain is defined by convention as wild type. However, during laboratory propagation Bristol <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" role="_blank">N2</ulink> can accumulate variation resulting in differences from the reference Bristol <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" role="_blank">N2</ulink> sequence. Therefore in cases where an investigator wants to associate phenotype with genotype, multiple lines of evidence are necessary to draw the conclusion that variation x leads to phenotype y. Every variation is assigned an accession of the form WBVariationDDDD. Some variations, for example mutant alleles and polymorphisms of certain types, are assigned an additional allele name.</para>

<sect2 id="sec3.1">
<title>Alleles/mutations from experimentally induced variation</title>
<sect3 id="sec3.1.1">
<title>&emsp;</title>
<para>Every allele has a unique designation. Alleles are given names consisting of one to three italicized letters (the allele designation for the assigning laboratory) followed by an italicized Arabic number, e.g., <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00142941;class=Variation" role="_blank">e61</ulink></emphasis> or <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00089058;class=Variation" role="_blank">mn138</ulink></emphasis> or <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00248701;class=Variation" role="_blank">st5</ulink></emphasis>. The last letter should not be an &ldquo;l&rdquo; to avoid confusion with the number &ldquo;1&rdquo;. For example, <emphasis role="italic">e</emphasis> refers (originally) to the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Cambridge, U.K.), (currently) to the laboratory of <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/resources/person/WBPerson261#013542--10">J.

<para>Where necessary, wild type sequence can be indicated using the symbol +. Because every genetic &ldquo;feature&rdquo; (i.e., difference from Bristol <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=N2;class=Strain" role="_blank">N2</ulink>) has a unique name, an animal&apos;s genotype is fully specified by listing all the named features that it carries.

<para>For clarity and convenience, additional information about genes, chromosomes, transgene contents, etc., can be added as described elsewhere in this document, to produce a more informative genotype.

<para>Strains carrying more than one mutation are designated by sequentially listing mutant genes or alleles according to the left-right (= up-down) order on the genetic map/genome sequence. Different chromosomes (linkage groups) are separated by a semicolon and given in the order <emphasis role="italic">I, II, III, IV, V, X, f, M.

For example: <emphasis role="italic">dpy-5(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00142941;class=Variation" role="_blank">e61</ulink>) I; bli-2(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00143470;class=Variation" role="_blank">e768</ulink>) II; unc-32(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00143023;class=Variation" role="_blank">e189</ulink>) III</emphasis>.</para>
<para>Integrated transgenes (<emphasis role="italic">Is</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic">Si</emphasis>) should be grouped with other mutant genes or alleles on the chromosome, if it is known into which chromosome the transgene is integrated. Extrachromosomal arrays (<emphasis role="italic">Ex</emphasis>) and unmapped integrated arrays should be included at the end of the genotype. Example: <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBTransgene00017864;class=Transgene" role="_blank"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar01473985;class=Variation" role="_blank">oxTi330</ulink></ulink> III; <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBTransgene00017865;class=Transgene" role="_blank">gaIs283</ulink></emphasis>.</para>
<para>Heterozygotes, with allelic differences between chromosomes are designated by separating mutations on the two homologous chromosomes with a slash.

<title>Phenotypes</title>
<para>Phenotypic characteristics can be described in words, e.g., <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">dumpy</ulink> animals or <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000643;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">uncoordinated</ulink> animals. If more convenient, a nonitalicized 3-letter or 4-letter abbreviation, which usually corresponds to a gene class or gene name, may be used. The first letter of a phenotypic abbreviation is capitalized, e.g., <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000643;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">Unc</ulink> for <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000643;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">uncoordinated</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">Dpy</ulink> for <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">dumpy</ulink>. If it is necessary to distinguish among related but distinguishable phenotypes, the relevant gene number can be added, e.g., Unc-4 and Unc-13 to differentiate the distinct phenotypes produced by mutations in the two genes <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006744;class=Gene" role="_blank">unc-4</ulink></emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006752;class=Gene" role="_blank">unc-13</ulink></emphasis>. <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink> maintains a standard set of defined phenotype descriptors (the <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink> Phenotype Ontology).</para>
<para>Abbreviations that do not correspond to a gene class or gene name can also be used, e.g., <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000700;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">Muv</ulink> for <emphasis role="italic">mu</emphasis>ltiple <emphasis role="italic">v</emphasis>ulval development, and Daf-c for <emphasis role="italic">da</emphasis>uer-<emphasis role="italic">f</emphasis>ormation-<emphasis role="italic">c</emphasis>onstitutive. To avoid ambiguity and conflicts, phenotype abbreviations <emphasis role="underline">not</emphasis> corresponding to a gene name are controlled by <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink> and requests for names should be made, prior to abstract or manuscript submission, via email to: <ulink url="mailto:genenames@wormbase.org">genenames@wormbase.org</ulink>.</para>
<para>A common and accepted convention, when comparing a mutant with the wild type, is to use the prefix non- to refer to the wild type phenotype, for example, non-Lin (= wild type cell lineage) or <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">Dpy</ulink> non-Unc (= wild type with respect to movement, but <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000583;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">dumpy</ulink> with respect to body shape).</para>

<sect1 id="sec7">
<title>Proteins</title>
<para>The protein product of a gene can be referred to by the relevant gene name, written in non-italic capitals, e.g., the protein encoded by <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006752;class=Gene" role="_blank">unc-13</ulink></emphasis> can be called UNC-13.</para>
<para>In some cases the gene name and the protein products have distinct names, often in situations where the gene name is based on phenotype and the protein product is named based on sequence similarity or biochemical activity. For example, for the gene <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00002335;class=Gene" role="_blank">let-60</ulink></emphasis> and the corresponding protein RAS, designation <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00002335;class=Gene" role="_blank">let-60</ulink></emphasis>/RAS or <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00002335;class=Gene" role="_blank">let-60</ulink></emphasis> RAS can be used.</para>
<para>Where more than one protein product is predicted for a gene (usually as a result of alternative message processing), the different proteins are distinguished by adding &lsquo;isoform&rsquo; and then the isoform letter derived from the isoform letter of the name of the <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/#012-34-5">WormBase</ulink> CDS, e.g., the gene &lsquo;tra-1&rsquo; has two CDS isoforms: &lsquo;Y47D3A.6a&rsquo; and &lsquo;Y47D3A.6b&rsquo; which give rise to the protein isoforms: &lsquo;TRA-1, isoform a&rsquo; and &lsquo;TRA-1, isoform b&rsquo;.</para>
<para>Mutant protein products can be named by the missense change, for example a mutant &lsquo;TRA-1, isoform a&rsquo; protein with a <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0001033;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">Pro</ulink> to Leu change at codon 79 would be written: &lsquo;TRA-1, isoform a (P79L)&rsquo;.</para>

<title>Strains</title>
<para>A strain is a set of individuals of a particular genotype with the capacity to produce more individuals of the same genotype. Strains are given non-italicized names consisting of two or three uppercase letters followed by a number. The strain letter prefixes refer to the laboratory of origin and are distinct from the allele (mutation) letter prefixes. Examples: CB1833 is a strain of genotype <emphasis role="italic">dpy-5(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00142941;class=Variation" role="_blank">e61</ulink>) unc-13(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00142935;class=Variation" role="_blank">e51</ulink>)</emphasis>, originally constructed by <ulink url="https://wormbase.org/resources/person/WBPerson77#01--10">S.

<para>Strains can and should be preserved as frozen stocks at &minus;70 &deg;C, or ideally in liquid nitrogen, in order to ensure long-term maintenance and to avoid drift or accumulation of modifier mutations.</para>
<para>Bacterial strain names employ the two or three letter Laboratory/Strain designation, followed by &ldquo;b&rdquo;. For example, CBb#. This facilitates distinguishing nematode strains from bacterial strains. Please provide full information on species and relevant genotype of the bacteria.</para>

<title>Species prefixes</title>
<para>In order to specify unambiguously the nematode species-of-origin, an optional 3-letter standard prefix and hyphen can be added to the gene name (<link linkend="table2">Table 2</link>).

<title>Gene naming: homologous genes</title>
<para>Genes predicted from whole genome sequences in other nematode species will, in many cases, have identifiable close homologs in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>, for which approved names already exist. In these cases, the same name should be used as in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>, with the relevant species identifier. <emphasis role="bold"></emphasis> Possible scenarios are listed below.</para>
<sect3 id="sec9.2.1">
<title>One-to-one</title>
<para>Where one gene in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> corresponds to a single gene in another nematode species, ortholog naming can be applied automatically. Example: <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00020172;class=Gene" role="_blank">thoc-1</ulink></emphasis> in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> has a <emphasis role="italic">C. briggsae</emphasis> ortholog, <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00042381;class=Gene" role="_blank">Cbr-thoc-1</ulink></emphasis>.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec9.2.2">
<title>One-to-many</title>
<para>Where one gene in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> is related to multiple genes (paralogs) in another nematode species, these paralogs can be named using additional decimal numbers. Example: <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00009341;class=Gene" role="_blank">thoc-3</ulink></emphasis> in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> has two <emphasis role="italic">C. briggsae</emphasis> paralogs, <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00033360;class=Gene" role="_blank">Cbr-thoc-3.1</ulink></emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00043048;class=Gene" role="_blank">Cbr-thoc-3.2</ulink></emphasis>.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec9.2.3">
<title>Many-to-one</title>
<para>Where multiple genes exist in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> but only a single gene in another nematode species, it is recommended that either the most closely similar, or the lowest numbered <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> gene, be used to name the single gene, as appropriate.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec9.2.4">
<title>Many-to-many.</title>
<para>Where multiple closely related genes can be identified in both species but the phylogenetic relationships of the two sets are complex, new gene numbers can be assigned to the set of genes in the other nematode species, after consultation with <ulink url="mailto:genenames@wormbase.org">genenames@wormbase.org</ulink></para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec9.2.5">
<title>A standard gene name has not yet been assigned in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis></title>
<para>The gene can be referred to using the sequence name, such as <emphasis role="italic">Hba-W01B11.3</emphasis>. However, in such cases it will usually be both feasible and desirable to assign a standard name to the <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> gene as well, at the same time.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sec9.3">
<title>Gene naming: non-homologous genes</title>
<para>It is expected that many genes in other nematode species will lack obvious close homologs in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>, because of loss or substantial divergence during the evolution of <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>. These genes can be given new gene numbers if they belong to an identifiable named class in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>, or else new gene name classes can be established for them. In either case, assignment of an approved name should be made after consultation with <ulink url="mailto:genenames@wormbase.org">genenames@wormbase.org</ulink></para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sec9.4">
<title>Gene naming: forward genetics</title>
<para>A significant amount of mutation-based forward genetic analysis is being pursued in nematodes other than <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>, in particular using other species of <emphasis role="italic">Caenorhabditis</emphasis> (<emphasis role="italic">C. briggsae, C. remanei, C. brenneri</emphasis>, and others), as well as species of <emphasis role="italic">Oscheius</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic">Pristionchus</emphasis>. It is expected that most, but not all, of the mutationally-defined genes discovered in these species will prove to have orthologs with equivalent or similar function in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>, and hence that standard genetic names will have been approved already. Possible situations are described below.</para>
<sect3 id="sec9.4.1">
<title>The molecular identity is known and orthology is obvious</title>
<para>It is recommended that the <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> name be used, with the appropriate species identifier prefix. Example: <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00195120;class=Gene" role="_blank">Ppa-mab-5</ulink></emphasis> is the <emphasis role="italic">Pristionchus pacificus</emphasis> ortholog of <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00003102;class=Gene" role="_blank">mab-5</ulink></emphasis>.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec9.4.2">
<title>The molecular identity is not initially known but the mutant phenotype corresponds to a known <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> mutant phenotype</title>
<para>To reduce gene renaming as much as possible, it is recommended that: a) new mutations should be mapped as precisely as possible, b) all relevant complementation tests should be done, and c) if the genome assembly for that species is sufficiently accurate, potential <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> orthologs should be tested by sequencing or RNAi. If the gene still seems to be novel, then a new gene class name can be established, following consultation with <ulink url="mailto:genenames@wormbase.org">genenames@wormbase.org</ulink> in order to ensure that the new name is available and appropriate. An appropriate name should describe the phenotype yet be distinct from the corresponding <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> name. If the molecularly identity is subsequently found to be conserved in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>, then the name would typically revert to the <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> name, but this would be determined on a case-by-case basis.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec9.4.3">
<title>The molecular identity is unknown and the mutant phenotype does not correspond to a known <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> mutant phenotype</title>
<para>A new gene class name can be established, following consultation with <ulink url="mailto:genenames@wormbase.org">genenames@wormbase.org</ulink> in order to ensure that the new name is available and appropriate. Example: <emphasis role="italic">cov</emphasis> = <emphasis role="italic">C</emphasis>ompetence and/or centering <emphasis role="italic">O</emphasis>f <emphasis role="italic">V</emphasis>ulva abnormal.</para>
