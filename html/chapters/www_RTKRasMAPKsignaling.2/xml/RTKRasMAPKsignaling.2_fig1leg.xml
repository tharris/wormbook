<title>Figure 1. The canonical RTK-Ras-ERK signaling pathway and alternative Ras-dependent pathways in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis></title>
<para>A) The canonical pathway. Positively acting factors are shown in green; negatively acting factors are in red. Only the most widely required and conserved factors are shown. GF, growth factor. TX, transcription. B) <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=LET-23;class=Protein" role="_blank">LET-23</ulink>/EGFR and C) <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=EGL-15;class=Protein" role="_blank">EGL-15</ulink>/FGFR both act in part through the canonical pathway, but they are activated by different ligands and control different sets of developmental processes. Included in B) are nuclear proteins, including two <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=MPK-1;class=Protein" role="_blank">MPK-1</ulink>/ERK substrates (<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=LIN-1;class=Protein" role="_blank">LIN-1</ulink>/ETS and <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=EOR-1;class=Protein" role="_blank">EOR-1</ulink>), that are jointly important for most LET-23-dependent somatic cell fates. Downstream targets of EGL-15-Ras-ERK signaling are not yet known. D) Ras-ERK functions to promote meiotic pachytene progression and various other aspects of germline development; the receptors that activate Ras-ERK for these functions are not currently known. <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=MPK-1;class=Protein" role="_blank">MPK-1</ulink>/ERK utilizes more than 30 different substrates in the germline. E) A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) may activate Ras-ERK signaling in some contexts. F) <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=LET-60;class=Protein" role="_blank">LET-60</ulink>/Ras can signal through the alternative Ral pathway.
