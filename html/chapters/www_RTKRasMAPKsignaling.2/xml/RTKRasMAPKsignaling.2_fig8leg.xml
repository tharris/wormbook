<title>Figure 8. Interactions between EGF-Ras-ERK and other signaling pathways</title>
<para>A) EGF-Ras-ERK and Wnt signaling cooperate to promote several cell fates. B) EGF-Ras-ERK and Notch signaling function antagonistically to promote distinct cell fates. C) The alternative EGF-Ras-Ral pathway and Notch cooperate to promote the secondary vulval fate. See text for details and references.</para>
