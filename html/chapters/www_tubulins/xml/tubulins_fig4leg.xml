Strain <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=SA250;class=Strain" role="_blank">SA250</ulink> contains GFP::TBB-2 as shown in panel A and mCh::TBG-1 in panel B, along with mCh::HIS-48 (histone 48), which appears more strongly in later blastomeres (<link linkend="bib151">Toya et al., 2010</link><!--: PMID 20719280-->). A merge of A and B is shown in panel C, and a DIC image is shown in panel D. Strain <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=TY3558;class=Strain" role="_blank">TY3558</ulink> contains GFP::TBB-2 and GFP::H2B (histone 2B) as shown in panel E, with corresponding DIC image in panel F (this strain is not referenced). In all panels, anterior is to the left. Note the asymmetric distribution of one or both of these components at the two-cell stage as seen by a brighter cytoplasm in <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=AB;class=Cell" role="_blank">AB</ulink> relative to <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P1;class=Cell" role="_blank">P1</ulink> (panel E) and that interphase blastomeres in older embryos show a cortical tubulin network (asterisks in panels A and C). Both strains are available at the <ulink url="http://cbs.umn.edu/cgc/home"><emphasis role="italic">Caenorhabditis</emphasis> Genetics Center</ulink> (CGC). Scale bar is 10 &mu;m.</para>
