		<para>Regulation of <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=hlh-1" role="_blank">hlh-1</ulink></emphasis> expression by lineage-preference elements. A) A schematic of body wall muscle nuclei is super-imposed on an image of a comma stage embryo. Each of four different lineages of origin is color-coded as shown in (B) (adapted from (<link linkend="bib116">Sulston et al., 1983</link><!--; PMID 6684600-->). C) The promoter and partial coding region (exons 1 and 2) of <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=hlh-1" role="_blank">hlh-1</ulink></emphasis> are shown (adapted from (<link linkend="bib62">Krause et al., 1990</link><!--; PMID 2175254-->). All expression is dependent on a &#x0201C;core&#x0201D; element (star) located upstream of the ATG of exon 1. Below the gene structure diagram are color-coded elements that can direct lineage-preference expression of transgenes during embryogenesis; color coding as in (A) and (B). Mature body wall muscle is dependent on distinct temporal elements (purple boxes) that do not have lineage preferences.</para>
