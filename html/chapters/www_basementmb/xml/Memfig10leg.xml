        <title>Figure 10. Comparison of CLE-1 and mouse collagen XVIII structures</title><para>The domains of CLE-1 and collagen XVIII are illustrated with percentages of amino acid sequence identity/similarity indicated in the CLE-1 representation. The longest form CLE-1A is shown. The amino terminus of CLE-1A is related to UNC-40, while mouse protein is related to Frizzled. TSP-related indicates similarity to the thrombospondin amino terminal domain.</para>
