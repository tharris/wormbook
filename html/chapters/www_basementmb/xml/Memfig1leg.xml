        <para>(A) Body wall muscle (m) and epidermis (e) have thin sheets of BM. The epidermal BM has a lollipop-like appearance (arrowhead). The outward-facing body wall muscle BM (white arrow) is thicker than the inward-facing BM (black arrow). (B) The BM surrounding the pharynx is very thick (arrows). (C) The distal tip cell (dtc) extends processes to cover part of the germ cells (g). The gonad and intestine (i) are covered by separate BMs. (D) The dtc has a thick BM (arrow), whereas a thinner BM (arrowhead) covers the germ cells.
