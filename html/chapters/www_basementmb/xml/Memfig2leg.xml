        <para>Major basement membrane molecules are represented in approximately appropriate relative sizes. Arrows represent biochemically defined interactions, mostly derived from studies of vertebrate molecules. The abilities of collagen IV and laminin to polymerize and perlecan to oligomerize are indicated by curved yellow arrows.</para>
