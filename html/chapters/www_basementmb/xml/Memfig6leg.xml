        <para>Wild-type hermaphrodites were labeled with GM1. (A) shows the head from a young adult. The arrow indicates the terminal bulb of the pharynx. Note the punctate pattern over this region. (B) shows a section of the body-wall muscles from a young adult. The large arrow indicates a dense body, the small arrow indicates an M-line, and the arrowhead indicates the margin of a body-wall muscle cell.
