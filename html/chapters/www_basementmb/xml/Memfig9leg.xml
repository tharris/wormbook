        <title>Figure 9. Immunolocalization of NID-1</title>
        <para>An L1 larva and adult stained with anti-NID-1 G3 domain antibody. In the L1 animal staining of multiple basement membranes is seen, but NID-1 is most strongly concentrated around the nerve ring. In the adult  animal, strong staining of sublateral nerve cords (SL), the ventral nerve cord/muscle edge (VC) and lateral edge of muscle quadrants (L) is seen.</para>
