        <title>Figure 7. Structure of the <emphasis>unc-52</emphasis> gene and protein products</title>
        <para>The <emphasis>unc-52</emphasis> gene consists of 37 exons and spans over 20 kb. Exons (boxes), introns (lines), and the three classes of protein products are shown. Mutant alleles used in this study are also indicated. The longest ORF encodes a protein of 3375 amino acids that is homologous to the mammalian heparan sulfate basement membrane proteoglycan perlecan. Like mammalian perlecan, this polypeptide can be divided into five domains (I-V). The first domain is unique, whereas the remaining four domains show similarity to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (domain II),<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;</symbol>-laminin (domains III and V), and NCAM (domain IV). Additional isoforms are generated through alternative splicing of exons encoding alternative C termini, indicated on the gene as shaded regions. The various protein modules are indicated with shaded boxes or circles. Reprinted from Molecular Biology of the Cell (Mol. Biol.
