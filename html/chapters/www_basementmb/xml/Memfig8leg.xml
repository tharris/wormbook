        <para>The domain structures of the three NID-1 alternative splice isoforms and two mouse nidogen genes are illustrated. The percentages of amino acid sequence identity/similarity between <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> and globular domains are shown. Thyroglobulin-like modules in the mouse proteins are indicated by TG.</para>
