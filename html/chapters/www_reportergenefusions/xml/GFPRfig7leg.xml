		<title>Figure 7. Generating <emphasis>promoter::ORF::gfp</emphasis></title>
		<para>The <emphasis>promoter::ORF::gfp</emphasis> vector is generated by a multi-site LR reaction between pENTRY-prom, pENTRY-ORF and pDEST-MB14. In this reaction, <emphasis>attL</emphasis> sites recombine with corresponding <emphasis>attR </emphasis>sites. The resulting plasmid, <emphasis>promoter::ORF::gfp</emphasis>, contains the promoter, ORF and GFP in frame with each other. pENTRY-ORF vectors are specifically designed to recombine in frame with GFP from pDEST-MB14.</para>
