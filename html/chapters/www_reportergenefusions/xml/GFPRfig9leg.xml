		<title>Figure 9: Isolation of GFP fusion construct</title>
		<para>To obtain yeast carrying only the pRS415-GFP-<emphasis>URA3</emphasis>-GFP recombinant vector, plasmids are transfered by cytoduction into the karyogamy-deficient <emphasis>kar1-1</emphasis> strain (CBY886). This step eliminates the presence of chromosomal insertions of GFP-<emphasis>URA3</emphasis>-GFP or unrecombined pRS415. Selection for the excision of <emphasis>URA3</emphasis> and generation of the final GFP fusion product occurs when yeast are grown on on solid medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid and lacking leucine.
