        <title>Figure 3. Generating a C-terminal translational PCR fusion</title>
        <para>Primers A and B amplify the genomic region (amplicon #1). Primer B adds a 24 bp overlap in frame to the GFP coding region. Primers C and D amplify the reporter gene (e.g., GFP) and 3' UTR (amplicon #2). Primers A* and D* are used to fuse amplicon #1 and amplicon #2 (gray box indicates 24 bp sequence overlap). The resulting fusion product (amplicon #3) can be directly injected into <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> without purification.</para>
