        <title>Figure 1. Gemline RNA <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization with an anti-sense and a sense probes.</title>
        <para>Representative photomicrographs of RNA <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridizations showing <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=cep-1" role="_blank">cep-1</ulink></emphasis>/p53 mRNA accumulation in wild-type (A) and <emphasis>gld-1</emphasis>(null) (B) hermaphrodites, and wild-type male (C). Each panel has images from gonads hybridized with an anti-sense probe and a sense probe otherwise treated equally. Each image shows a surface view of the gonad where the distal region is on the left and the proximal region is on the right. Sense probe gave no or very little signals (the proximal signal is likely due to endogenous phosphatases). In wild-type hermaphrodites, <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=cep-1" role="_blank">cep-1</ulink></emphasis> mRNA accumulates throughout the germ line and its levels increase toward the proximal region of the germ line. In <emphasis>gld-1</emphasis>(null), <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=cep-1" role="_blank">cep-1</ulink></emphasis> mRNA levels are slightly lower as compared with wild type. In wild-type males, <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=cep-1" role="_blank">cep-1</ulink></emphasis> mRNA accumulates at higher levels only in the distal meiotic germ cells, showing sexual dimorphism.</para>
