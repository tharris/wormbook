        <title>Figure 7. Map of the balanced regions of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> chromosomes</title>
	<para>Each chromosome is represented by a vertical bar with cross lines indicating genetic positions of a subset of identified genes (some genes defining the endpoints of minor balancers are not shown where space is limited). By convention, the top end of each vertically drawn chromosome corresponds to the left end when drawn horizontally, and the bottom of each corresponds to the right end. Shading of the chromosomes indicates the degree of balancing. Black represents well-balanced regions, crosshatching represents regions balanced by unstable or uncharacterized rearrangements, and no shading represents regions for which no balancers exist. Approximately 70% of the genome is well balanced. Balancers are drawn to the left of each chromosome as double-line bars (duplications) or bars with different shading patterns (other balancers). Endpoint lines on each balancer indicate its genetic extents. Some rearrangements that provide balancing of limited reliability are not shown. Also not shown are duplications that balance small intervals.</para>
