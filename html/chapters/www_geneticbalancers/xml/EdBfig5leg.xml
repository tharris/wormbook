        <title>Figure 5. Example of a crossing scheme using <emphasis>hIn1</emphasis> to generate genotypically and phenotypically unique balanced males carrying a desired lethal mutation</title>
	<para>The standard male balancer strain and a sample balanced lethal strain are represented by genotypes in the boxes on the left. The genotypes and phenotypes of the four classes of cross progeny resulting are shown on the right. Both male and hermaphrodite cross progeny will be present. This example illustrates a basic principle of marker manipulation, which can be adapted for other balancers and markers.</para>
