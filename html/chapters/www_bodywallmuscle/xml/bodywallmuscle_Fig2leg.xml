<title>Figure 2. Muscle development observed by transmission EM.</title>
<para>Electron micrographs are representative of muscle cells from wild type L1, L2, L3, and L4 larvae and young adults. All images were identically orientated with the cuticle at the bottom. Pseudo coloring indicates dense bodies (yellow), M-lines (orange), mitochondria (green), endoplasmic reticulum (pink), and sarcoplasmic reticulum (blue) localized around the dense bodies. Scale bars correspond to 0.5 &mu;m in L1 to L4, and 0.2 &mu;m in young adults. Figure adapted by N. Brouilly from <link linkend="bib29">Brouilly et al., 2015</link><!--:PMID 26358775-->.</para>
