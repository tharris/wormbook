<title>Figure 9. Crystal structure of a portion of twitchin containing its protein kinase domain.</title>
<para>(A) Schematic representation of domains in the originally described twitchin molecule. Ig domains, violet; Fn3 domains, green; protein kinase domain, as indicated; non-domain regions, clear. (B) On top shows a region of twitchin near its C-terminus, and in color, which portions were included in the new crystal structure. The numbering of domains corresponds to the numbering of domains in (A). NL denotes the N-terminal linker, a 45-residue segment lying between Fn31 and the kinase catalytic core (kin); CRD denotes the &ldquo;C terminal regulatory domain&rdquo;, a 60-residue segment that lies between the kinase catalytic core and Ig26. Below shows the crystal structure in three rotated views. A white arrowhead indicates helix &alpha;R2 of CRD that blocks the ATP binding site. The CRD wedges itself between the two lobes of the catalytic core (shown in grey space-filling mode), and blocks the binding sites for ATP and protein substrate. The NL forms a &ldquo;crown&rdquo; that rests on the back of the interlobe kinase hinge region, with its remaining chain folded against the N-terminal lobe, sprawling across the &beta;1-&beta;2 hairpin containing the glycine-rich loop in the ATP binding pocket. The NL also makes direct contacts with the catalytic helix &alpha;C. In vitro kinase assays show that both the CRD and the NL each inhibit catalysis by one-half. In steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, it is the NL that first responds to pulling force, whereas the CRD remains bound to the C-terminal kinase lobe. Note that in part B, both in the schematic drawing and crystal structures, the Fn domain is blue and the Ig domain is green (different from Figure 9A and Figure 10).
