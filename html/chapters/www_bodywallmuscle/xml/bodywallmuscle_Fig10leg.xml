<title>Figure 10. Progress in identifying proteins that interact with the giant protein UNC-89.</title>
<para>On top is a schematic representation of domains in the largest <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE30426;class=Protein" role="_blank">UNC-89</ulink> isoform, UNC-89-B, which contains 8081 residues. Ig domains, violet; Fn3 domains, green; a 645 residue long region containing multiple copies of the 3 amino acid triplet KSP, yellow; protein kinase domains, SH3, DH, and PH domains, as indicated. Open rectangles beneath this schematic denote segments used for screening a Y2H library. Interactions have been verified by a combination of demonstrating binding in vitro using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization in muscle, and identifying muscle mutant phenotypes. Interacting proteins identified so far are indicated as ovals with their protein names (including in parentheses the names of the human homolog or nature of the protein) with arrows leading from the segments of <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE30426;class=Protein" role="_blank">UNC-89</ulink> that interact with them. Brief descriptions of the type of protein (e.g., CTD-type phosphatase) and/or mutant phenotype of the interacting protein (e.g., <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000053;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">Pat</ulink> <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000050;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">embryonic lethal</ulink>) are indicated.</para>
