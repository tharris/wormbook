<title>Figure 11. Structure of human and <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> dystrophin proteins.</title>
<para>The structure of the large muscular isoform of human muscular dystrophin is presented (adapted from <link linkend="bib19">Blake et al., 2002</link><!--:PMID 11917091-->) along with the two isoforms (A and B) of <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE49403;class=Protein" role="_blank">DYS-1</ulink>. The size of human dystrophin and <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE49403;class=Protein" role="_blank">DYS-1</ulink> isoform A is approximately analogous. The N-terminal ends of these proteins share 20% homology and correspond to an actinin/calponin like actin binding domain (blue). The C-terminal ends share 37% homology and contain WW, EF Hand, and Zinc Finger (ZZ) motifs as well as coiled-coil domains (orange). The central rod domains, which shares only 10% homology, contains helical spectrin-like repeats (purple). The distribution and abundance of spectrin repeats varies between species, 24 were found in the sequence of human dystrophin and 7 in DYS-1A. The predicted short isoform DYS-1B corresponds to the last 237 amino acids of isoform A. Figure designed by <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/resources/person/WBPerson31463">M.
