		<title>Figure 1. Behavioral responses of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> to ethanol.</title>
<para>(A) Dose-response curve describing the inhibitory effects of ethanol on speed (<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x2022;</symbol>) and frequency of egg laying (<!--<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x25AF;</symbol>-->&#x25A1;) of the wild-type (N2) strain. The measured internal concentration of ethanol in the animals for the 400 mM and 500 mM treatments was 22 <symbol role="symbolfont">&plusmn;</symbol> 0.8 mM and 29 <symbol role="symbolfont">&plusmn;</symbol> 0.5 mM respectively. Error bars, s.e.m. (B) Ethanol-induced decrease in body-bend amplitude during locomotion. Ethanol (200 mM) causes a small decrease in the amplitude of body bends. Complete flattening of the body bends can occur at 400- and 500-mM ethanol. The effect is most pronounced on the posterior of the body (left). Scale bar, 200 <symbol role="symbolfont">&mu;</symbol>m.</para>
