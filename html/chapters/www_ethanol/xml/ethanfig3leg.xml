		<title>Figure 3. Acute ethanol tolerance in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> varies between two wild strains.</title>
		<para>(A) The relative speed (&percnt; of the speed of untreated animals) of three strains increases during a continuous exposure to exogenous ethanol (500 mM). The wild strain, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=CB4856;class=Strain" role="_blank">CB4856</ulink> and a CB4856-derived strain that had been outcrossed seven times to the N2 strain, and selected for a rapid development of acute tolerance at each outcross, demonstrate more rapid recovery of speed (acute tolerance), particularly in the 10&ndash;30 minute interval than does the N2 wild strain. Error bars, s.e.m. (B) <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> has low permeability to exogenous ethanol. The internal ethanol concentration (mM) within the two wild strains, N2 and <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=CB4856;class=Strain" role="_blank">CB4856</ulink>, at the 10-, 30 and 50 minute time points remains constant but <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=CB4856;class=Strain" role="_blank">CB4856</ulink> demonstrated higher internal ethanol concentrations than N2.</para>
