<title>Figure 7. Force generation by filament packing.</title>
<para>Schematic diagram of MSP filament dynamics. Nucleation of MSP assembly at the leading edge of the pseudopod (head of arrow) produces numerous short, densely packed filaments. Increasing filament length behind the leading edge reduces packing density, thereby increasing filament volume and generating force. MSP disassembly at the trailing edge of the pseudopod (tail of arrow) allows filament repacking at higher density, which decreases volume and propels the cell body forward.</para>
