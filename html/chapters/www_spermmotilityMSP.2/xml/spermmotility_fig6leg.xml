<title>Figure 6. Regulation of MSP assembly.</title>
<para>Components identified by reconstituted MSP polymerization assay. Polymerization-enhancing steps indicated by green arrows; depolymerization steps in red. Phosphorylation of MPOP by an unidentified protein tyrosine kinase (PYK) at the tip of the pseudopod promotes MPAK recruitment. MPAK phosphorylates MFP2, which stimulates MSP assembly, while MFP1 antagonizes MSP assembly. Phosphorylation of MFP3 by an unidentified protein threonine kinase (PTK) stabilizes MSP filaments. Dephosphorylation of MFP3 by PP2A at the base of the pseudopod destabilizes the filament and drives disassembly of MSP.</para>
