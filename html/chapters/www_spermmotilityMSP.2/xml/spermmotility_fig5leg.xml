<title>Figure 5. Structure of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> MSP.</title>
<para>(A) MSP monomer. Backbone trace demonstrates the seven-stranded immunoglobulin-like fold. (B) MSP dimer. Sidechains involved in dimer formation are shown in red. (C) MSP subfilament. Sidechains involved in subfilament interaction between two dimers are shown in green. The leftmost monomer in B and C is the same size and orientation as in A. Structure coordinates are available as entry 1GRW from the Protein Data Bank.</para>
