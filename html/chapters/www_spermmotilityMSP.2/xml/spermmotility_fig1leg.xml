<title>Figure 1. MSP distribution during sperm cell development.</title>
<para>Top, schematic diagram; bottom, photomicrographs of sperm labeled with MSP-specific antibodies. In primary spermatocytes, MSP (green) begins to assemble as paracrystalline arrays in fibrous bodies associated with the membranous organelles (FB-MOs). Assembly continues through the secondary spermatocyte stage. FB-MOs segregate into spermatids during the budding division. After spermatids separate from the residual body (RB) during cytokinesis, MSP dissociates into the cytosol. Upon activation, MSP reassembles into filamentous fibers in the pseudopod.
