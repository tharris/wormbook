        <title>Figure 2. Model illustrating general aspects of CDK regulation</title>
        <para>CDK activation requires cyclin (CYC) expression and association. Cyclin/CDK complexes
            are kept inactive through association with CDK-inhibitory proteins (CKIs) and inhibitory
            phosphorylation by Wee1/Myt1 kinases (black circles). Activation requires
            ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of the CKI, phosphorylation of the CDK by a
            CDK-activating kinase (CAK; red circle), and removal of the inhibitory phosphates by a
            Cdc25 phosphatase. Cyclin destruction leads to inactivation. Ubiquitin-dependent
            proteolysis of cell cycle regulators in late G<subscript>1</subscript> and S involves cullin-based E3 ligases
            such as SCF, while in M phase and early G<subscript>1</subscript> the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is
            active. The exclamation figure denotes the active kinase complex, the large arrow
            indicates time.</para>
