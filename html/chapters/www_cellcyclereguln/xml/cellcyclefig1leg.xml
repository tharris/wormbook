        <title>Figure 1. Simple representations of the cell cycle</title>
        <para>(A) a typical (somatic) cell cycle, which can be divided in four sequential phases:
                G<subscript>1</subscript>, S, G<subscript>2</subscript> and M. M phase consist of
            nuclear division (<emphasis role="bold">mitosis</emphasis>) and cytoplasmic division
                (<emphasis role="bold">cytokinesis</emphasis>) (B) variant cell cycles in which
            specific phases are omitted. (C) approximate time of activity for different combinations
            of cyclins and CDKs, based on studies of mammalian cyclins and CDKs. <emphasis>C.
                elegans</emphasis> family members are indicated between brackets. Shapes outside the
            cycle indicate increase and reduction of corresponding CDK/cyclin activity. </para>
