        <title>Figure 1. Proliferation in wild-type and selected mutant germ lines</title>
        <para>The wild-type germ line begins in the early embryo with a single primordial germ cell
            (PGC), which divides once during embryogenesis. After hatching, the two PGCs begin their
            post-embryonic divisions to generate about 2000 germ cells in the adult (Kimble and
            White, 1981<!-- : PMID7202837 -->). By contrast, in <emphasis>glp-1</emphasis> null mutants, which lack the
            GLP-1/Notch receptor, the two PGCs make only 4-8 germ cells (Austin and Kimble, 1987<!-- :
            PMID3677168 -->); in <emphasis>glp-1</emphasis> gain-of-function mutants, which have unregulated GLP-1/Notch
            receptors, they generate up to ~4000 germ cells (Berry et al., 1997<!-- : PMID9043073 -->); and
            in <emphasis>fbf-1(ok91)</emphasis> <emphasis>fbf 2(q704)</emphasis> mutants, which lack the FBF RNA-binding protein, germ cells
            divide until early L4 to make ~100 germ cells (Crittenden et al., 2002<!-- : PMID12050669 -->).
            In both <emphasis>glp-1(0)</emphasis> and <emphasis>fbf-1 fbf-2</emphasis> mutants, all germ cells leave the mitotic cell cycle,
            enter the meiotic cell cycle and undergo spermatogenesis. In <emphasis>glp-1(gf)</emphasis> mutants, all germ
            cells remain in the mitotic cell cycle. </para>
