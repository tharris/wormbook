        <para>(A) Representation of the adult hermaphrodite gonad. The anterior arm (on the left)
            shows the germ line and the posterior arm (on the right) shows the somatic cells of the
            gonad arm. Ten gonadal sheath cells cover the gonad arm. The position of one member of
            each pair is shown (1-5). The proximal sheath cells (pairs 3-5) contract to drive
            ovulation. (B) Dissected gonad from a wild-type young adult hermaphrodite illustrating
            oogenic meiotic progression. Bars, 10 <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03BC;</symbol>m.

            Immunofluorescent micrograph of the contractile proximal gonadal sheath cells (pairs
            3-5). Nuclei detected by DAPI staining (blue) and myofilaments in red (MHCA) and green
            (MHCB). Reproduced from <link linkend="bib25">Hubbard and Greenstein (2000)<!--: PMID10822256--></link> with permission.
            (D) Gap junction (gj) between oocyte and proximal sheath cell. Photograph modified from
            <link linkend="bib19">Hall et al. (1999<!--: PMID10419689-->)</link> with permission. (E) High magnification view of a
            freeze-fracture replica of sheath cell 4 covering the â€“2 oocyte. Clustered
            intra-membrane particles and pits correspond to gap junctional channels (GJ) between the
            oocyte and sheath cell. Irregular sheath pores (p) form fenestrae through which the
            oocyte surface is visible. Photograph modified from <link linkend="bib19">Hall et al. (1999<!--: PMID10419689-->)</link>
