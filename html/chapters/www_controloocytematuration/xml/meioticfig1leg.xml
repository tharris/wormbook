        <title>Figure 1. Oocyte Meiotic Maturation and Egg Activation</title>
        <para>The oocytes of most animal species arrest in meiotic prophase I (reviewed by <link linkend="bib43">Masui and
            Clarke, 1979</link><!--: PMID385540-->; <link linkend="bib42">Masui, 2001</link><!--: PMID11776390-->). In response to a hormonal stimulus
            (1-methyladenine in starfish; progesterone in Xenopus; MSP in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>), oocytes begin
            meiotic maturation: the nuclear envelope breaks down (GVBD), as the oocyte enters
            M-phase from prophase. The point of fertilization is species-specific. In the case of <emphasis>C.
            elegans </emphasis>(I) fertilization occurs after maturation but prior to completion of meiosis I.
            In <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, fertilization is required for completing both meiotic divisions. For most
            insects (II), fertilization occurs at metaphase or anaphase I. In most vertebrates
            (III), fertilization occurs at metaphase II. Sea urchins complete meiosis before
            fertilization (IV). </para>
