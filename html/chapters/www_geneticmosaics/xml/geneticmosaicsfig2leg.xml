        <title>Figure 2. Mosaicism and drug resistance or susceptibility resulting from loss of a
            <emphasis>bre-5+</emphasis> extrachromosomal array during division of the blastomere <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=EMS;class=Cell" role="_blank">EMS</ulink> in an otherwise
            <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=bre-5" role="_blank">bre-5</ulink></emphasis> mutant background.</title>
        <para>Inheritance of the array during development is inferred from expression of a green
            marker also present on the array. During development of the embryo in A, the array was
            inherited by <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=MS;class=Cell" role="_blank">MS</ulink> but not by E, its sister. <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=MS;class=Cell" role="_blank">MS</ulink>, the progenitor of several mesodermal cell
            types (a few in the pharynx are indicated), is not a progenitor of intestinal cells.
            They, instead, all derive from E, which only gives rise to intestinal cells (<link linkend="bib12">Sulston et
            al., 1983</link><!--: PMID 6684600-->). Mosaics, such as the example in A, that have not inherited the
            array in the intestine (black nuclei), are resistant to the <emphasis>Bacillus thuringiensis</emphasis>
            toxin, indicating that <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=bre-5" role="_blank">bre-5</ulink></emphasis> is required in the intestine for susceptibility (<link linkend="bib2">Griffitts
            et al., 2001</link><!--: PMID11486087-->). In contrast, the intestinal cells in mosaic B should
            express wild-type <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=bre-5" role="_blank">bre-5</ulink></emphasis>, because they have inherited the array (green nuclei). The
            presence of wild-type <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=bre-5" role="_blank">bre-5</ulink></emphasis> in the gut makes the animal competent to ingest the toxin,
            resulting in intestinal pathology.</para>
