<title>Figure 1: General overview of the worm tracking procedure.</title>
<para>A movie of the behaving animal is taken either using a camera attached to a microscope (A) or with a camera and its macro function (B). Depending on the tracker software, a motorized stage (X, Y) can be used to keep the worm in the field of view. For simplicity, only one worm is depicted in the movie (C); multi worm trackers may track over 100 worms at the same time. Individual pictures or frames (D) are extracted from the video file, which are subsequently converted to binary (black and white) images (E). This operation is handled differently in each worm tracker implementation and mainly consists of thresholding and gap filling. When a motorized X-Y stage is used, the software calculates the worm&#x0027;s position in the binary image and moves its center of mass to the middle of the frame. In the next step, the worm&#x0027;s skeleton (F) is calculated from the binary image, which is further divided into individual segments (G). Different parameters (H) can be calculated based on the segmented skeletonized pictures, which are stored for further processing.</para>
