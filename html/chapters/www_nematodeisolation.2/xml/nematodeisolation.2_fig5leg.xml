<title>Figure 5. A few remarkable and common worms that are easy to distinguish from <emphasis>Caenorhabditis</emphasis> (part I: non-rhabditids).</title>
<para>See Section <ulink url="#sec3-1-2" title="3.1.2.&nbsp;Vignettes of non-rhabditid nematodes co-habiting with Caenorhabditis">3.1.2</ulink>. for comments. Arrowheads denote vulva positions. The &#x2018;t&#x2019; above the diplogastrid mouth indicates the strongly cuticularized and massive teeth of diplogastrids. Laid embryos are visible in some panels as oval-shape objects on the <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> lawn. In the <emphasis>Panagrellus</emphasis> panel, the filled arrowhead denotes the position in the female where embryos start to accumulate up to the vulva, which is labeled with an empty arrowhead.</para>
