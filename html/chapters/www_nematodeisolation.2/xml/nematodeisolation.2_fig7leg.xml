<title>Figure 7. Distinguishing <emphasis>Caenorhabditis elegans</emphasis> from <emphasis>C. briggsae.</emphasis></title>
<para>The following are morphological indications to distinguish the two species on a pure culture, but these cues do not replace a molecular or crossing test. Left panels: all <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> wild isolates (top) clump and border at the edge of the <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> lawn, whereas <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> isolates (bottom) do not clump nor border. Right panels: <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> isolates tend to accumulate many embryos (arrowheads) in their uterus before laying, and lay embryos at >10-cell stage. Note that some wild <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> isolates lay their eggs earlier than N2 and that most, unlike N2, clump and congregate at the edge of the <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> lawn; also consider that young adults may not have accumulated many embryos yet. <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> isolates all lay very early-stage embryos (one or two-cell stage) and generally do not have more than two fertilized embryos in their uterus under standard laboratory conditions. <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> also generally looks thinner and somewhat paler than <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. The third known hermaphroditic species, the tropical <emphasis>C. tropicalis</emphasis> is even thinner than <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis>. Bars of left panels: 1 mm; of right panels: 0.1 mm.</para>
