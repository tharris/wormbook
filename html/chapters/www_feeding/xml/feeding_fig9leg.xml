<para><emphasis role="bold">Leaving probability depends on food quality.</emphasis> This graph summarizes 11 leaving probability measurements. In each experiment naive hatchlings starved for about a day were placed 2 mm from an elliptical 1 &#x00D7; 2 mm colony of bacteria and videotaped. P<subscript>L</subscript> is determined for each minute as the ratio of the number of worms leaving the colony to the total number of worms in the colony. The average over the time from 30 to 90 min is plotted here. Each point is color-coded for worm strain and shaped-coded for bacterial strain as indicated in the legends.
