<para><emphasis role="bold">The pharyngeal muscle action potential. A.</emphasis> A train of pharyngeal action potentials recorded from TB muscle. This recording was chosen to illustrate features of the action potential discussed in the text. The features visible in this recording are not always observed. In particular, the resting potential is often much more negative, and the positive slope between action potentials is not always seen (<link linkend="bib19">Cook et al., 2006</link><!--: PMID 18050442-->). <emphasis role="bold">B.</emphasis> Schematic pharyngeal muscle action potential showing the action of the major ion channels.</para>
