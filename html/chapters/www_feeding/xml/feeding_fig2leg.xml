<para><emphasis role="bold">Pharyngeal pumping.</emphasis> A pharyngeal pump begins with a near-simultaneous contraction of the muscles of the corpus, anterior isthmus, and TB. Contraction of corpus and isthmus muscles pulls the lumen open. Liquid and suspended particles flow in through the mouth. At nearly the same time the TB muscles contract, inverting the plates of the grinder, which grind up bacteria and pass the debris back to the intestine. The near-simultaneous contraction is followed by a near-simultaneous relaxation that returns the grinder to its resting position and expels liquid from the corpus and isthmus.
