<para><emphasis role="bold">Large bacteria are poor food.</emphasis> The bar graph shows growth rates of wild-type worms and three different feeding-defective mutants on 16 different bacterial strains. The bacteria are listed in order of decreasing <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=eat-2;class=Gene" role="_blank">eat-2</ulink></emphasis> growth rate. Above the bar graph are photographs of each of the bacterial strains as they appear when isolated from lawns on nematode growth medium. All pictures are on the same scale; a scale bar is shown to the left. In addition, 0.8 &#x03BC;m blue-dyed latex beads were mixed in with the bacteria as an internal size standard. These are identified by black dots. A strong although not perfect inverse correlation between growth rate and bacterial size is obvious.
