<para><emphasis role="bold">Food-seeking depends on experience. A.</emphasis> Na&#x00EF;ve L1s were conditioned for 3 hours on the indicated bacteria then their probability of leaving a small spot of medium quality food <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> DA837 was measured as in Figure 9. &#x201C;Empty plate&#x201D; means the worms were left on a plate without food for 3 hours, instead of being conditioned on bacteria. Worms that have experienced high quality food leave medium quality food at higher frequency. <emphasis role="bold">B.</emphasis> After conditioning for 2 hours, worms were tested for their ability to cross a ring of medium quality food to find a spot of high-quality food in the center. Worms conditioned on high-quality food performed this task better. Adapted, with permission, from <link linkend="bib71">Shtonda and Avery (2006)</link><!--: PMID 16354781-->.</para>
