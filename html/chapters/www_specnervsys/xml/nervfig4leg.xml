        <title>Figure 4. Combinatorial gene expression patterns determine cell fates</title>
        <para>This schematic diagram illustrates three principles. First, individual neuron types (here: AIY) are defined not by the expression of unique terminal differentiation genes, but by the expression of a unique combination of more broadly expressed genes (here: <emphasis>sra-11</emphasis>, <emphasis>hen-1</emphasis>, <emphasis>kal-1</emphasis> and <emphasis>unc-17</emphasis>; <link linkend="bib1">Altun-Gultekin et al., 2001</link>). Second, the co-expression of terminal differentiation markers is regulated by <emphasis>cis</emphasis>-regulatory control elements (here illustrated for the <emphasis>sra-11</emphasis> gene) that are occupied in a cell-type specific manner and combinatorial sets of co-expressed transcription factors (Wenick and Hobert, 2004). Third, the combinatorial co-expression of gene regulatory factors is again brought about by specific <emphasis>cis</emphasis>-regulatory elements that control the expression of these regulatory factors. Cell type specification therefore involves hierarchical levels of combinatorial codes of co-expressed genes. Note that for simplicity, the gene regulatory events shown here are based on transcriptional activation. Figure 5 illustrates that apparent activation could in fact be due to sequential repression. "1" indicates expression of a gene, "0" indicates no expression. The binary behavior of gene expression is an oversimplification since intermediary levels of gene expression can also be instructive, but it is nevertheless a useful concept if one takes "1" to mean that the level of gene expression is sufficient to confer a specific property to a cell and "0" to mean insufficient levels of gene expression.</para>
