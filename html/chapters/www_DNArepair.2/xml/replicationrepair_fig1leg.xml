<title>Figure 1. Expression profile during <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> development.</title>
<para>Expression profile clustering of a set of DNA repair genes using nearest neighbor hierarchical clustering of the normalized RNA-seq data from the modEncode website is shown (<ulink url="http://www.modencode.org">www.modencode.org</ulink>). The cluster analysis has been modified by hand somewhat to aggregate some groupings. The top axis is the developmental profile from fertilization to adult hermaphrodite. There is a clear change in the expression pattern at column six at the onset of gastrulation (150 min post fertilization), marked by a purple bar. A darker purple bar marks the mid-first larval stage. The green bars indicate mutant strains used. The darker green is a germline-minus strain, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=JK1107;class=Strain" role="_blank">JK1107</ulink>. Adjacent to the left are mid-larval females and young pre-gravid adult hermaphrodites. Clustering and figure prepared by Dr. Jeffrey Chu, University of British Columbia.</para>
