		<title>Figure 4. Single channels recorded from cultured touch neurons.</title>
		<para>Wild type and <emphasis>mec-4(null)</emphasis> touch neurons express a non-selective voltage-independent mechanosensitive channel. (<emphasis role="bold">A</emphasis>) Application of negative (but not positive) pressure to a touch neuron patch of membrane in the cell-attached configuration induces the activation of channels. (<emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis>) With release of the pressure the channels transition to the close configuration. The mechanically-gated channel is present in ~ 30 % of the patches examined. (<emphasis role="bold">C</emphasis>) Single channel openings of the mechanically-gated channel at voltages from <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x02212;</symbol>60 to + 100 mV during application of negative pressure. (<emphasis role="bold">D</emphasis>) Single-channel current-voltage relationship estimating a conductance of ~ 100 pS for the mechanically-gated channel.</para>
