        <title>Figure 1. Active transposons in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis></title>
        <para>The structure of the transposons that proved to be mobile are depicted in the left
            panel. They all are class II DNA tranposons flanked by Terminal Inverted Repeats (boxes)
            and containing one open reading frame (arrows) encoding the transposase enzyme.
            Distribution of the different transposons in the genome of the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> Bristol N2
            strain is represented in the right panel using the same color code as on the right (Tc7
            are in light blue; however, as represented on the left panel, 36 of the 38 outer bp of
            Tc7 are identical to the one of Tc1) The sizes of the chromosomes are in Mb. Reprinted
