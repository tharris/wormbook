        <title>Figure 3. Repair at the excision site</title>
        <para>Excision of a Tc1/mariner transposon generates a double-strand break in the chromosome
            <emphasis>(blue)</emphasis>. In this example, the homologous chromosome <emphasis>(red)</emphasis> is homozygous for the Tc
            insertion. The double-strand break is repaired by the cellular machinery using different
            possible pathways. Ends can be resected, resulting in 3' single-stranded ends that can
            engage a recombination process. If the homologous chromosome (or the sister chromatid)
            is used as a template, the repair process regenerates an intact copy of the transposon
            at the site of excision <emphasis>(left panel)</emphasis>. If resection exposes complementary strands of
            homologous sequences on the same chromosome <emphasis>(dotted ellipse)</emphasis>, repair can occur by
            single-strand annealing and generates variable deletions of the sequence flanking the
            site of excision <emphasis>(middle panel)</emphasis>. Alternatively, repair can be achieved by non-homologous
            end-joining (NHEJ)<emphasis>(right panel)</emphasis>. In that case, ends are processed and repair leaves
            short footprints <emphasis>(dotted rectangle)</emphasis>. For Tc1 and Tc3, one of the most common footprints
            contain two nucleotides from the transposon end <emphasis>(dark blue)</emphasis> and the duplicated TA.</para>
