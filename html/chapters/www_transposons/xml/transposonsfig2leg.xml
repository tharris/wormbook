        <title>Figure 2. Mechanism of Tc3 transposition</title>
        <para>Tc3, a member of the Tc1/mariner transposon superfamily, is mobilized by a
            "cut-and-paste" mechanism. The transposase excises the transposon by causing
            double-strand breaks at the end of the transposon (arrow heads). The DNA cut is
            staggered, resulting in a two-base pair 3'-hydroxyl overhang at each termini. Following
            excision, transposons then integrates 5' of a thymidine nucleotide at a TA target
            sequence using the free 3' hydroxyl as a nucleophile. Repair of the resulting
            single-strand gaps causes a duplication of the TA dinucleotide at each transposon end.
