<title>Figure 2. Two distributions with similar means and SDs.</title>
<para>Panels A and B show histograms of simulated data of vulval muscle cell contraction durations derived from underlying populations with distributions that are either bimodal (A) or normal (B). Note that both populations have nearly identical means and SDs, despite major differences in the population distributions. Panel C displays the same information shown in the two histograms using individual data plots. Horizontally arrayed sets of dots represent repeat values.</para>
