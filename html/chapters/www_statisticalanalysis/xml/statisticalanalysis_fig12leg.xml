<title>Figure 12. Illustration of the Central Limit Theorem for binomial proportions.</title>
<para>Panels A&ndash;D show results from a computational sampling experiment where the proportion of successes in the population is 0.25. The <emphasis>x</emphasis> axes indicate the proportions obtained from samples sizes of 10, 20, 40, and 80. The <emphasis>y</emphasis> axes indicate the number of computational samples obtained for a given proportion. As expected, larger-sized samples give distributions that are closer to normal in shape and have a narrower range of values.</para>
