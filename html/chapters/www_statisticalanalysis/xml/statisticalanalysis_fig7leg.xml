<title>Figure 7. Illustration of Central Limit Theorem for a skewed population of values.</title>
<para>Panel A shows the population (highly skewed right and truncated at zero); Panels B, C, and D show distributions of the mean for sample sizes of 15, 30, and 60, respectively, as obtained through a computational sampling approach. As indicated by the <emphasis>x</emphasis> axes, the sample means are approximately 3. The <emphasis>y</emphasis> axes indicate the number of computational samples obtained for a given mean value. As would be expected, larger-sized samples give distributions that are closer to normal and have a narrower range of values.</para>
