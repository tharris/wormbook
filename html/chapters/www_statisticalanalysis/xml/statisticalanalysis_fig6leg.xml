<title>Figure 6. Theoretical and simulated sampling distribution of differences between two means.</title>
<para>The distributions are from the gene expression example. The mean and SE (SEDM) of the theoretical (A) and simulated (B) distributions are both approximately 11.3 and 1.4 units, respectively. The black vertical line in each panel is centered on the mean of the differences. The blue vertical lines indicate SEs (SEDMs) on each side.</para>
