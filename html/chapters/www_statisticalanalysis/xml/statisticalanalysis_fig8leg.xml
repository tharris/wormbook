<title>Figure 8. Graphical representation of a two-tailed <emphasis>t</emphasis>-test.</title>
<para>(A) The same theoretical sampling distribution shown in Figure 6A in which the SEDM has been changed to 5.0 units (instead of 1.4). The numerical values on the <emphasis>x</emphasis>-axis represent differences from the mean in original units; numbers on the green background are values corresponding to the black and blue vertical lines. The black vertical line indicates a mean difference of 11.3 units, the blue vertical lines show SEs (SEDMs). (B) The results shown in panel A are considered for the case where the null hypothesis is indeed true (i.e., the difference of the means is zero). The units on the <emphasis>x</emphasis>-axis represent differences from the mean in SEs (SEDMs). As for panel A, the numbers on the green background correspond to the original differences. The rejection cutoffs are indicated with red lines using ( = 0.05 (i.e., the red lines partition 5% of the total space under the curve on each tail. The blue vertical line indicates the actual difference observed. The dashed blue line indicates the negative value of the observed actual difference. In this case, the two-tailed <emphasis>P</emphasis>-value for the difference in means will be equal to the proportion of the volume under the curve that is isolated by the two blue lines in each tail.</para>
