        <title>Figure 3. Epigenetic imprint on the paternal X chromosome</title>
		<para>Adult hermaphrodite gonads and embryos were fixed and stained with anti-H3methK4 (green) and counterstained with DAPI (red). All chromosomes of the mature oocyte stain with anti-H3methK4 (A). This modification (like all others tested: see text) is not detectable in spermatids (B). Upon fertilization, H3methK4 accumulates on all of the sperm-derived autosomes, but is absent from the X chromosome (white arrow) (C). The paternal X chromosome remains refractory to this histone modification even after extensive decondensation (white arrow in D), and multiple rounds of cell division (not shown; <link linkend="bib1">Bean et al., 2004</link>). Note that panel C shows a fertilized oocyte shortly after fertilization and during the second meiotic division, while Panel D shows a slightly later staged one-cell zygote during pronuclear fusion.</para>
