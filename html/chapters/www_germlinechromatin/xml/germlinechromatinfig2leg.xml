        <title>Figure 2. Different histone modification patterns on the hermaphrodite and male X
            chromosomes</title>
        <para>Adult pachytene stage nuclei were fixed and stained with antibodies to specific
            histone modifications (green) and counterstained with DAPI (red). In the hermaphrodite
            germline, the X chromosome pair (white arrows) does not stain with anti-H3methK4 (A) or
            anti-H3methK9 (C). H3methK4, but not H3methK9, eventually accumulates on the
            hermaphrodite X chromosome during diplotene (<link linkend="bib12">Kelly et al., 2002</link>). In the male testis,
            the X chromosome never stains with anti-H3methK4 (B) but does stain strongly with
            anti-H3methK9 (D). Scale bar equals 5<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x03BC;</symbol>m.</para>
