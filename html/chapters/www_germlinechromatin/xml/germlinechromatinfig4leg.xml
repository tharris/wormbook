		<title>Figure 4. Extrachromosomal array expression and histone modifications in the germline</title>
		<para>Repetitive extrachromosomal transgenes are often silenced in adult germ cell nuclei. Silencing of transgene arrays can be alleviated by decreasing the copy number of the reporter transgene, and increasing the &#x201C;complexity&#x201D; of the array DNA. Panels A and B show a DIC image (A) and GFP fluorescence (B) of a transgenic animal with a &#x201C;complex&#x201D; array carrying a <emphasis>let-858::gfp</emphasis> reporter-a gene that should express in all cells. Panel C shows the expression pattern of the same reporter in a repetitive transgene. The germ cell nuclei in the gonad are circled in A-C. The silenced, repetitive transgene in the strain depicted in C is depleted of H3methK4 (D) and enriched in H3methK9 (F); arrows in D-G point to the transgene. Panels D and G: Red is DAPI; Green is antibody signal for the respective histone modifications. Panels E and F are DAPI stains of Panels D and G, respectively.</para>
