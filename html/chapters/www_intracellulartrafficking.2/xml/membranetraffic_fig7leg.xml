<title>Figure 7. SAND-1 promotes RAB-5 to RAB-7 conversion during endosome maturation.</title>
<para>RAB-5 is activated by Rabex-5 (RABX-5) on endosomes; activated RAB-5 recruits its effectors including PI 3-kinase Vps34. SAND-1/CCZ-1 is then recruited by binding GTP-bound RAB-5 and PI(3)P on the early endosomes. SAND-1 displaces of Rabex-5 from the membrane and enhances dissociation of RAB-5 from the early endosomes. SAND-1/CCZ-1 also binds to HOPS subunits and is likely to activate RAB-7 directly, thereby promoting assemble of RAB-7 and its effector HOPS on endosomes.</para>
