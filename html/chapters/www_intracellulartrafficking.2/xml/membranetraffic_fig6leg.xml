<title>Figure 6. RME-1 is a membrane bending protein required for recycling endosome function.</title>
<para>(A) Shows the basal surface of the intestinal cells in animal expressing GFP::RME-1. Note that the tubulovesicular network of basolateral recycling endosomes is labeled by GFP::RME-1. (B) Shows an immuno-EM image of fixed intestinal tissue using an anti-RME-1 antibody. Endogenous RME-1 is restricted to the junction of the vesicular and tubular regions of the recycling endosomes where it is likely to regulate fission of cargo-containing tubules. (C) Purified RME-1 proteins were reconstituted on synthetic liposomes. In the presence of ATP&gamma;S, RME-1 assembles in rings (striations on tubules) and squeezes the liposome membranes into narrow tubules in a manner very similar to that of Dynamin (GTP&gamma;S).</para>
