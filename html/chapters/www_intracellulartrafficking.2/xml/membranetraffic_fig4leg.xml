<para>RME-6 and RME-4 are conserved exchange factors for RAB-5 and RAB-35, respectively, and are both associated with clathrin-coated pits. RME-6-mediated activation of RAB-5 prepares the nascent vesicles to fuse with the early endosomes. RME-4-mediated activation of RAB-35 prepares for recycling of internalized receptors to the PM.</para>
