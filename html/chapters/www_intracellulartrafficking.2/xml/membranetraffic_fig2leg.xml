<title>Figure 2. General mechanisms of membrane budding and fusion.</title>
<para>Vesicles (transport carriers) are formed from the donor membrane (budding), and this process is mediated by Arf/Sar GTPases and coat proteins. Arf/Sar GTPases and coat proteins are also involved in sorting of cargo proteins into vesicles. After uncoating, Rab GTPases recruit tethering factors that help v-SNAREs on vesicles to pair with specific t-SNAREs on acceptor membranes (tethering). Then, v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs are paired (SNARE pairing), mediating the selective fusion of vesicles with the correct acceptor membrane. After fusion, SNARE complexes are disassembled by N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) and &alpha;-soluble NSF attachment protein (&alpha;-SNAP), and are reused.</para>
