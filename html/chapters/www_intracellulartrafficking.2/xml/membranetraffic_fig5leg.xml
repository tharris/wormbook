<title>Figure 5. Cargo recycling through endocytic pathways in polarized intestinal cells and non-polarized cells.</title>
<para>Transport pathways connecting the common recycling endosomes, apical recycling endosomes, basolateral early endosomes, the Golgi, and the PM, are indicated with different colors (left). The known regulators, which are involved in each process, are listed in the middle with each color indicating each transport pathway. Model cargos, which are endocytosed from the basolateral PM via clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) or clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE), are also indicated. In nonpolarized cells, both CDE and CIE cargos are transported to recycling endosomes or the Golgi via common early endosomes (right).</para>
