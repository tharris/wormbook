<para>(A) YP170::GFP endocytosis by oocytes. YP170::GFP is synthesized in the intestine and secreted into the body cavity from which it is endocytosed by oocytes. RME-2 is the yolk receptor expressed in oocytes. Fluorescent micrographs of wild-type and typical <emphasis>rme</emphasis> mutant worms expressing YP170::GFP are shown. (B) GFP endocytosis by coelomocytes. Signal sequence-tagged GFP is synthesized in muscle and secreted into the body cavity. Coelomocytes efficiently take up GFP from the body cavity and accumulate GFP in lysosomes. Fluorescent micrograph of wild-type and typical <emphasis>cup</emphasis> mutant worms expressing GFP are shown. High magnification image of a wild-type coelomocyte is also shown. </para>
