        <para>DAF-7 promotes continuous, nonDauer development. The DAF-7 signal is transduced by  DAF-1 type I receptor, DAF-4 type II receptor, and DAF-8 and DAF-14 Smads. These   components, when activated, inhibit the functions of DAF-3 Smad and DAF-5 Sno/Ski, which promote Dauer development. BRA-1 is a negative regulator of DAF-1.</para>
