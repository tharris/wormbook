        <title>Figure 1. A schematic view of a non-seam epidermal cell</title>
        <para>(A) All epidermal cells contain actin microfilaments and microtubules, but only dorsal
            and ventral epidermal cells contain intermediate filaments. In addition to cortical
            actin MFs, there are circumferential MF bundles, which are intermingled with MTs, and
            at least in embryos are less apical than MTs. It is unclear whether IFs are closer to
            MTs or to MFs. The cell-cell adhesion complex known as the CeAJ (<emphasis>C.
            elegans</emphasis> apical junction) has been simplified for clarity, leaving only the
            cadherin-catenin complex (CCC; for further details, see Fig. 3A). There are more CeAJs
            than actin MF bundles. Dorsal and ventral cells establish fibrous organelles (FOs),
            which are junctions with the extracellular matrix that mechanically couple muscles to
            the cuticle. For the sake of clarity, several FO components were not drawn. (B)

            cells in embryos (picture, courtesy of Dr. Renaud Legouis). Note that a single electron
            dense area can be observed (red arrow). (C) Transmission electron micrograph of FOs in
            the dorsal epidermis of embryos (green arrowheads, electron dense plaques). (D) Adult
            stained with the MH5 mAb showing the VAB-10A pattern in adults (a FO component). (E)
