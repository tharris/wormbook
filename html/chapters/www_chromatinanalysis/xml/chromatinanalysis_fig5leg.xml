<para>Radial scoring using the three zones methods. <emphasis role="bold">A.</emphasis> A z stack across the embryo is acquired using a confocal microscope. Typical projection along the z axis is shown for an embryo carrying a <emphasis>lacO</emphasis>-tagged locus bound by GFP-lacI (2 spots per nucleus) and expressing a nuclear periphery marked (GFP-LMN-1). <emphasis role="bold">B.</emphasis> Blow-up of a single nucleus from A. <emphasis role="bold">C.</emphasis> Determination of the xy plane in which the two copies of the tagged locus are located using maximal fluorescence intensity. Spots appear elongated due to the image acquisition system (point spread function). <emphasis role="bold">D.</emphasis> For each spot in the plane for which its brightness is maximal, measurements of the diameter of the nucleus (red line) and the shortest distance from the spot to the nuclear rim (black line). The section of the nucleus is binned into 3 zones of equal surface (1, 2 and 3). <emphasis role="bold">E.</emphasis> Binning of measurement into 3 zones for a number of loci/nuclei. The dark blue series are enriched at the nuclear periphery (zone 1) while the light blue series are enriched in the nuclear interior (zones 2 and 3, red dotted line: random distribution, figure adapted from <link linkend="bib36">Meister et al., 2010b</link><!--: PMID 20395364-->). <emphasis role="bold">F.</emphasis> Comparison of the ideal measurement (shell method) and the zone scoring. The excluded volumes are highlighted (figure adapted from <link linkend="bib35">Meister et al., 2010a</link><!--: PMID: 20946824-->). A systematic although minor bias is introduced towards enrichment in the nuclear interior.</para>
