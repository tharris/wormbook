<title>Figure 1. Experimental steps for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of protein-DNA interactions.</title>
<para>Embryos are isolated from gravid adults by bleaching and are cross-linked with formaldehyde. Larvae are prepared by breaking frozen popcorn (drops of worms snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen) by grinding or mixer mill before cross-linking. Chromatin is sheared by sonication to a size between 200-1000 bp, and the target protein is immunoprecipitated along with cross-linked DNA using specific antibodies. In parallel, a portion of the extract is taken for Input DNA. Crosslinks are reversed by heat and DNA is purified. ChIP binding is quantified compared to Input DNA using quantitative PCR, DNA microarrays (ChIP-chip) or high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).</para>
