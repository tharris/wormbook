<title>Figure 2. Principles of DamID analysis of protein-DNA interactions.</title>
<para><emphasis>In vivo</emphasis> expression of trace amounts of DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) fused to a chromatin-associated protein (&#x201C;gene-of-interest&#x201D;) generates specific methylation marks (G<superscript>m</superscript>ATC) normally not found in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. As control for DNA accessibility, a strain expressing GFP-Dam is analyzed in parallel. Genomic DNA (gDNA) is purified and incubated with <emphasis>Dpn</emphasis>I restriction enzyme to specifically cleave Dam-methylated G<superscript>m</superscript>ATC sites. Depending on whether DNA arrays (DamID-chip; left) or high-throughput sequencing (DamID-seq; right) is used to identify methylated DNA, different oligonucleotide adaptors are ligated to the cleaved ends. For DamID-chip both samples are digested with <emphasis>Dpn</emphasis>II enzyme to cut all non-methylated GATC sequences (for simplicity only one sample is shown). This generates a pool of DNA fragments, of which only the ones that are flanked by two G<superscript>m</superscript>ATC sequences without intervening non-methylated sites can serve as PCR templates. Finally, amplified DNA fragments from the two strains are identified and quantified by co-hybridization to DNA arrays. Alternatively, for DamID-seq short tags for sequencing are generated by using adaptors with a recognition site for a restriction enzyme that cuts 19-27 nt from the recognition site (e.g., <emphasis>Mme</emphasis>I). After digestion, a second adaptor is ligated to the tags, which are then amplified by PCR. One or several purification steps are included to isolate &sim;120 bp DNA fragments, which are identified by high-throughput sequencing.</para>
