        <title>Figure 3. Summary of gamete interactions in the hermaphrodite during self-fertilization</title>
        <para>(A) Spermatids (in pink) are crowded at the oviduct spermathecal junction by maturing
            oocytes. (B) Spermatids are pushed into the spermatheca by the first ovulation. (C)
            Spermatids undergo spermiogenesis to become spermatozoa and compete with each other to
            fertilize the oocyte. (D) The newly fertilized egg exits the spermatheca and pushes many
            sperm into the uterus. (E) The displaced sperm crawl from the uterus back into the
            spermatheca. (F) The second ovulation places an oocyte in the spermatheca and sperm
            compete to fertilize it. The cell body is pulled behind the pseudopod as spermatozoa
            crawl forward.</para>
