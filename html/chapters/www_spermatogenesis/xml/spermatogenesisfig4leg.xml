        <para>(A) Hermaphrodite-derived spermatozoa wait in the spermatheca, where they fertilize
            nearly all oocytes that pass through the spermatheca. (B) A hermaphrodite after being
            inseminated by relatively few male-derived (blue) sperm will produce a mixture of self
            (pink embryo) and outcross (blue embryo) progeny. (C) A hermaphrodite after being
            inseminated by many male-derived (blue) sperm will produce only outcross (blue embryo)
            progeny. As noted by others, male-derived sperm are ~50% larger than
            hermaphrodite-derived sperm (<link linkend="bib16">LaMunyon and Ward, 1995</link><!--; PMID 7649241-->; <link linkend="bib17">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</link><!--; PMID 9821364-->). Adapted from <link linkend="bib44">Singson et al. (1999)</link><!--; PMID 10224254-->.</para>
