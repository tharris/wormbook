<title>Figure 2. Anterior-posterior in one-cell stage embryos.</title>
<para>Left: images from time-lapse differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (see Movie 1); time is displayed in min:sec from the beginning of the recording. Middle: images from time-lapse fluorescence confocal microscopy at approximately corresponding stages (from <link linkend="bib116">Munro et al., 2004</link><!--: PMID 15363415-->). Right: corresponding schematics, illustrating the distribution of the anterior (red) and posterior (blue) PAR proteins. Embryo is approximately 50 &mu;m long and is surrounded by an eggshell (visible in A and shown schematically in C). (A) At symmetry breaking, surface contractions of the cortical actomyosin network (red, wiggled line) cease in the vicinity of the centrosome, resulting in the generation of a small smooth cortical domain (blue, smooth line). (B) During polarity establishment, the smooth cortical area expands anteriorly to eventually reach 50% egg-length. Concomitantly, GFP::PAR-2 expands towards the anterior, whereas GFP::PAR-6 retracts from the posterior. (C, D) During centration/rotation (C) and mitosis (D, anaphase shown here), AP polarity is maintained by the mutual inhibition of the anterior and posterior cortical domains.
