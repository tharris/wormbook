<title>Figure 1. Generation of founder cells in the early embryo.</title>
<para>Anterior is to the left, posterior to the right, dorsal is up and ventral down in this and all subsequent figures. (A) Cell lineage of the early embryo. The horizontal lines connect sister cells; the length of the vertical lines indicates the relative cell cycle duration of each founder cell. The major cell types produced from each founder cell are shown. (B) Schematic diagram of cell positions at different stages.  The germ-line precursors (P cells) are shown outlined with green, and each of the founder cells generated by asymmetric division are indicated with a different color. The daughters of founder cells are named by their position; e.g., ABa is the anterior daughter of <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=AB;class=Cell" role="_blank">AB</ulink>, whereas <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=ABal;class=Cell" role="_blank">ABal</ulink> is the left daughter of ABa. The embryo proper is surrounded by an eggshell, schematized by a black line.</para>
