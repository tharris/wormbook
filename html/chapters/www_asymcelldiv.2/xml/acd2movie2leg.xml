<title>Movie 2. Dual fluorescent and DIC microscopy of one-cell stage embryo carrying mCherry::PAR-6 and GFP::PAR-2 from the onset of polarity establishment until the early two-cell stage.</title>
<para>mCherry::PAR-6 is pseudocolored in red; GFP::PAR-2 in blue. Note that, for illustration purposes, only the cortical aspect of the mCherry::PAR-6 and the GFP::PAR-2 signals is shown. Time is indicated in seconds from the beginning of the recording. Courtesy of Simon Blanchoud (G&ouml;nczy laboratory).</para>
