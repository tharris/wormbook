<title>Movie 3. Simulation of a mathematical model of polarity establishment.</title>
<para>Model developed by <link linkend="bib56">Goehring et al. (2011b)</link><!--: PMID 22021673-->. Depicted are the concentrations of the anterior (red) and the posterior (blue) polarity complexes at the cell membrane. The embryo is depicted in 1D, taking advantage of the rotational symmetry of the process, with the anterior pole on the left (-67.5 &micro;m) and the posterior pole on the right (0 &micro;m). The perturbation of the initial uniform configuration results from an advective force that models the cortical flows observed <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis>. Time is in seconds after simulation onset. Note that the concentrations have been normalized to set their respective maximal value at 100. Note also that the values of the parameters for this simulation were set as proposed by <link linkend="bib56">Goehring et al. (2011b)</link><!--: PMID 22021673-->.
