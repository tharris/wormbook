<caption>    <formalpara>        <title>Figure 2. Phylogeny of <emphasis>Caenorhabditis</emphasis> species represented by            living strains and four outgroup representatives</title>        <para>Black numbers on the branches denote percentage jackknife support from 2,000            replicates for an analysis incorporating all taxa shown using SSU and LSU rRNA genes and            RNAP2 with the third codon positions deleted. Red numbers denote jackknife support in            5,000 replicates for an analysis that included the seven most closely related            <emphasis>Caenorhabditis</emphasis> species for SSU and LSU rRNA genes, and coding regions from genes for                RNAP2, <emphasis>par-6</emphasis>, and <emphasis>pkc-3</emphasis> with the third            codon positions included. Third codon positions were only saturated with substitutions            in pairwise comparisons involving species less closely related to <emphasis>C.            elegans</emphasis> than <emphasis>C.</emphasis> sp.
