        <title>Figure 3. Evolution of reproductive mode</title>
        <para>Reproductive modes were determined for the terminal taxa and mapped onto the
            molecular phylogeny depicted in <link linkend="figure1">Figure 1</link>. Two <emphasis>Oscheius</emphasis> species and
            the lineage to strongylids (dashed lines) were added according to their position in
            phylogenies obtained with SSU rDNA alone. Red branches represent lineages in which
            hermaphroditism evolved; blue branches represent lineages in which gonochorism occurred;
            orange indicates heterogonic mode (different generations switch between gonochoristism
            and hermaphroditism); green indicates probable or known parthenogens. Character states
            for ancestral lineages were inferred by parsimony under the assumption that character
            state changes are equally likely and reversible. Right-click or control-click to see larger image.</para>
