<caption>    <formalpara>        <title>Figure 4. Evolution of male tail tip morphogenesis</title>        <para>Orange branches represent evolutionary lineages in which males had unretracted tail            tips, which are therefore pointed in shape and referred to as "leptoderan" if there is a            fan; green represents lineages in which males had retracted tail tips, which are thus            rounded in shape and are referred to as "peloderan," as in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. Gray represents            lineages for which the character state cannot be decided. Using the phylogeny depicted            in <link linkend="figure1">Figure 1</link>, ancestral states were inferred by parsimony under the assumption that            character state changes are equally likely and reversible.
