<caption>    <formalpara>        <title>Figure 5. Intron evolution in part of the RNAP2 gene of            <emphasis>Caenorhabditis</emphasis> species</title>        <para>The presence (+) or absence (-) of            introns at particular sites (a-q) in the RNAP2 gene is depicted as a matrix (question            marks indicate missing data). For sites a, b, e, g, h, k-o, and q, a single,            unequivocal, most parsimonious history of intron insertion/deletion could be inferred            (rectangles on the branches of the phylogeny). For the other sites, more than one most            parsimonious scenario exists under the assumption that gains and losses are equally            probable. Sites at which a single deletion occurred during            <emphasis>Caenorhabditis</emphasis> cladogenesis are marked in dark blue; purple            indicates sites at which two deletions occurred; light blue and orange indicate sites at            which deletions and subsequent reinsertions could have occurred; red indicates a unique            intron insertion.
