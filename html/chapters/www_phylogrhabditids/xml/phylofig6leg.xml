        <title>Figure 6. (A) Comparisons of evolutionary divergences in SSU rRNA genes between
            species pairs within nematodes (red) and deuterostomes (green)</title>
        <para>Pairwise divergences were estimated by summing lengths of intervening branches between
            taxa in (B); standard deviations (error bars) were calculated as the square root of the
            sum of the squares of the SDs of these branches. (B) Likelihood phylograms for SSU rRNA
            genes used to calculate the divergences graphed in (A). Species relationships within
            each group were assumed. A general time-reversible model (accounting for rate
            heterogeneity across sites with some fraction of invariant sites, GTR+I+<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x0393;</symbol>) was used to estimate branch lengths (substitutions per site
                &#x000B1; 1 standard deviation). Divergences
            between any pair of taxa were then calculated as the sum of the branch lengths
            separating those taxa on the tree. (Modified from Kiontke, 2004<!-- : PMID15184656 -->). Right-click or control-click to see larger image.</para>
