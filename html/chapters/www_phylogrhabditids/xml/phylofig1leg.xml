        <title>Figure 1. Rhabditid phylogeny as inferred by weighted parsimony jackknife analysis
            using DNA sequences from three genes (SSU and LSU rRNA and RNA polymerase II)</title>
        <para>Strain designations are given for species available as stocks. Gray taxa names
            designate outgroup representatives. Some of the clearer monophyletic groups are
            delineated with brackets. Numbers on the branches indicate the percentage of 1,000
            jackknife replicates in which the branch appeared (50% of randomly chosen sites were
            deleted in each replicate). For each jackknife replicate, four random sequences of taxon
            addition were used to generate starting trees. Branches were collapsed where jackknife
            values were below 50%. The position of the strongylid clade, inferred from previous
            analyses (<link linkend="bib3">Blaxter et al., 1998</link><!-- : PMID9510248-->; <link linkend="bib11">Fitch and Thomas, 1997</link>), is shown as
            a dashed line. (KK and DF, unpublished; details of the analysis will be published
            elsewhere.). Right-click or control-click to see larger image.</para>
