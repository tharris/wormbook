		<para>The <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=hyp;class=Cell" role="_blank">hyp</ulink> 7 syncytium covers most of the dorsal surface and parts of the ventral surface of the head and tail. The 12 unfused ventral hypodermal cells, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P1;class=Cell" role="_blank">P1</ulink>/2 to <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P11;class=Cell" role="_blank">P11</ulink>/12 are positioned in two parallel rows with each cell across from its bilateral homolog along the ventral midline. In the L1 stage, these cells interdigitate to from a single row of cells on the ventral surface. There are eight seam cells along the each side of the animal, H1 and H2 in the head; V1-V6, along the body; and T in the tail. Anterior is to the right.
