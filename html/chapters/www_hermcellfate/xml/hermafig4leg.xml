		<title>Figure 4. Male and hermaphrodite L1 larvae.</title>
		<para>At hatching, male and hermaphrodite larvae are anatomically identical apart from a few cells (blue labels). Most sex-specific tissues of the adult are formed from the descendents of blast cells (black labels), that are present in both sexes but express different fates or lineages in each sex.
