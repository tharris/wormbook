	<para>From mutant parents that have been mutagenized, the F1 progeny and F2 grandprogeny are examined for phenotypic revertants, that is animals that do not display the mutant phenotype. Each F1 examined screens two mutagenized gametes, as either the sperm or the ova could carry a mutation. If the F2 are examined, the number of mutagenized gametes is also two per F1. m, starting mutation; sup, suppressor mutation.</para>
