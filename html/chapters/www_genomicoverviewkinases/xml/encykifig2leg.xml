        <title>Figure 2. Orthology between <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> kinases</title>
        <para>Squares indicate likely orthologous pairs of kinases, and circles denote paralogous
            expansions. <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> sequences are predictions (CBGnnnnn) from the genome project. (A)
            In the worm-specific KIN-16 family, new genes continue to arise in the <emphasis>elegans</emphasis> and
            <emphasis>briggsae</emphasis> lineages, as indicated by circles. (B) In the CDK family, all 13 members exist
            as orthologous pairs and subfamilies (labeled) are also conserved in <emphasis>Drosophila</emphasis> and human.</para>
