        <para>Ras-superfamily GTPases bound to GTP are active signaling molecules. The intrinsic
            GTPase activity of the molecule hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, and GDP-bound forms are inactive.
            GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) enhance GTPase activity and favor the inactive,
            GDP-bound state. GTP exchange factors (GEFs) faciltiate exchange of GDP with GTP and
            thus favor the active, GTP-bound state.</para>
