        <title>Figure 4. Phylogenetic tree of SSD proteins</title>
        <para>A multiple sequence alignment of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (<emphasis>Ce</emphasis>), <emphasis>Drosophila</emphasis> (<emphasis>Dm</emphasis>) and human (<emphasis>Hs</emphasis>) SSD
            proteins was produced in Clustal X and the built-in neighbor joining was used to
            generate a tree using the default values (not corrected for multiple substitutions, gaps
            not excluded). 1000 bootstrap trials were run, and trial values are shown in the figure
            as percentages. Seven families of SSD proteins can be distinguished. Based on
            the bootstrap values, the PTC, NPC, Disp and PTR are more similar to each other. It is
            clear that the PTR family has expanded substantially in nematodes. <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/protein?name=PTR-24;class=protein" role="_blank">PTR-24</ulink> does not fall
            within the clade of the PTR family, but we still believe it to be a divergent member of
            the PTR family. The PTR family itself seems to be composed of two subfamilies that each
            diverged and expanded to an equal extent. MSA data provided by O. Zugasti.</para>
