        <title>Figure 3. Phylogenetic tree of exostosin domain proteins from <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (<emphasis>Ce</emphasis>), <emphasis>Drosophila</emphasis> (<emphasis>Dm</emphasis>) and human (<emphasis>Hs</emphasis>).</title>
        <para>A multiple sequence alignment was produced using Clustal X (<link linkend="bib61">Thompson et al., 1997</link><!--: PMID 9396791-->) and the built-in neighbor joining was used to generate a tree using the
            default values (not corrected for multiple substitutions, gaps not excluded). 1000
            bootstrap trials were run, and trial values are shown in the figure as percentages. An
            <emphasis>Arabidopsis thaliana</emphasis> (<emphasis>At</emphasis>) exostosin domain containing protein was included as an
            outgroup. The three families conserved between flies and human are indicated.</para>
