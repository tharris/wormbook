<title>Figure 1. Diagrammatic representation of polymorphism and divergence.</title>
<para>Dotted lines delimit independently evolving lineages (species); solid lines trace the genealogy of an ortholog between species. Polymorphism at a locus is shown within species B and C, as represented by a genealogy in each species that coalesces into the single common ancestor of the extant polymorphism within that lineage. Only a single representative copy of the locus is represented for species A. The expected coalescent time for extant polymorphism is 4N<subscript>e</subscript> generations. Divergence between distantly-related species typically involves comparison of a single representative sequence for a locus from each species. For example, if the lengths of branches are proportional to the number of mutations that have accumulated along them, then divergence between A and B would be the sum of the lengths of the dark and light blue, purple, and orange branches. Using the colored copies of the locus as representatives from each of these 3 species, one could calculate lineage-specific rates for species B and C. Lineage-specific divergence for C (orange) would be equivalent to summing the lengths of the red and pink branches, if the position of their common ancestry could be inferred accurately. Differences in mutation rates and/or generation times can result in variable lineage-specific branch-lengths.</para>
