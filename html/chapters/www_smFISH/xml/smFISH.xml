<title>Introduction</title>
<para>In <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, the expression pattern of a gene provides important clues to understanding its biological function. To accurately depict endogenous transcriptional activity, a highly sensitive method is required to measure transcript levels in the intact tissue across various developmental stages. Conventional RNA <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization methods using hapten- (biotin or digoxygenin) labeled RNA probes rely on antibody binding for visualization, and are thus only semi-quantitative at best (<link linkend="bib8">Raap <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 1995</link><!--PMID: 7633400-->; <link linkend="bib5">Levsky <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2003</link><!--PMID: 12808017-->). Additionally, hapten-labeled probes are prone to diffuse localization (when conjugated with alkaline phosphatase), low sensitivity (when conjugated with fluorescent molecules), and non-specific probe binding. Here, we introduce a recently developed mRNA <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization method (<link linkend="bib11">Raj <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2008</link><!--PMID: 18806792-->) that circumvents the above difficulties to give single molecule resolution of transcript detection.</para>
<para>The single molecule fluorescent <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization (smFISH) method differs from conventional approaches by using many short (about 20 base pairs long) oligonucleotide probes to target different regions of the same mRNA transcript (<link linkend="bib11">Raj <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2008</link><!--PMID: 18806792-->; <link linkend="bib1">Femino <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 1998</link><!--PMID: 9554849-->). Each oligo is conjugated with only one fluorophore and thus faintly visible by itself. Binding of multiple oligos to the same transcript yields a bright spot, indicative of a single mRNA transcript. Since mis-bound probes are unlikely to co-localize, this method effectively reduces false-positive signal from non-specific probe binding. The small oligo size allows the probes to efficiently penetrate through target tissue, yielding robust detection of even low-abundant transcripts. Subsequently, the total number of fluorescent spots within a single cell or region can be unambiguously counted and compared across different developmental stages and genetic backgrounds.</para>
<para>Given its many advantages, the smFISH method is a powerful tool to study transcriptional regulation. Its high sensitivity allows accurate characterization of the spatio-temporal patterns of endogenous gene expression. Its single-molecule resolution enables precise quantification of gene expression levels. Such quantitative information can in turn be used to assess, for example: 1) tissue-specific correlations in gene expression, 2) similarity and difference in gene expression across strains, 3) variability in gene expression, and 4) tissue-specific signaling dynamics. To date, smFISH has been successfully applied to study a variety of questions in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> biology (<link linkend="bib9">Raj <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2010</link><!--PMID: 20164922-->; <link linkend="bib3">Harterink <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2011</link><!--PMID: 21653614-->; <link linkend="bib4">Korzelius <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2011</link><!--PMID: 22102824-->; <link linkend="bib7">Middelkoop <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2012</link><!--PMID: 22074987-->; <link linkend="bib13">Saffer <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2011</link><!--PMID: 22242000-->; <link linkend="bib14">Seidel <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2011</link><!--PMID: 21814493-->; <link linkend="bib15">Topalidou <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2011</link><!--PMID: 21368126-->).

<title>Protocols</title>
<para>The following protocol covers the 5 major steps of smFISH: <emphasis role="bold">A.</emphasis> Probe design and synthesis, <emphasis role="bold">B.</emphasis> Fixation of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> worms and embryos, <emphasis role="bold">C.</emphasis> Hybridization, <emphasis role="bold">D.</emphasis> Image acquisition, <emphasis role="bold">E.</emphasis> Data analysis. This protocol is largely adapted from the general smFISH protocol detailed in <link linkend="bib10">Raj and Tyagi (2010</link><!--PMID: 20580972-->), with notes and modifications specific to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. Unless otherwise noted, all reagents listed can be made in bulk ahead of time and stored at room temperature (RT).</para>

<listitem><para>Number of probes: ideally between 30 and 96 depending on target transcript length. Typically 48 probes are used to ensure good signal quality, while as few as 20 have yielded satisfactory signal (e.g., <link linkend="figure1">Figure 1</link> illustrates the result from 27 probes designed to target <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=mab-5;class=Gene" role="_blank">mab-5</ulink></emphasis> mRNA).

<sect3 id="sec2-1-2">
<title>Synthesis, coupling and purification.</title>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Synthesis:</emphasis> Based on the designed oligonucleotide sequences, smFISH probes are generated en masse using a 96-well DNA synthesizer. Biosearch Technologies (Novato, CA) offers synthesizing service for custom-designed smFISH probes. The probes can be ordered in both coupled and uncoupled forms. While ordering coupled probes minimizes the work involved in probe preparation, obtaining uncoupled probes allows the flexibility to choose fluorophores that are optimally compatible with the researcher&#x0027;s microscope setup (e.g., filter cubes) and other experimental needs. Furthermore, coupled probes are delivered as a mix, which precludes the option of using subsets of the probe library to 1) selectively target different parts of the transcript, or 2) perform negative controls using deletion mutants (see additional comment in the following section and details of suggested controls in the Controls and Troubleshooting section). In the following section, we further suggest a list of factors to consider when deciding whether to pursue in-house coupling.</para>
<para>Given the small amount of probes needed for each hybridization experiment, synthesis can be carried out at a small scale (Biosearch now delivers 5 nmol of each probe per custom order. This amount is typically sufficient for hundreds of experiments). When ordering uncoupled probes, the oligonucleotide probes should be synthesized with a 3&#x2019;amine group to allow subsequent oligo-fluorophore conjugation. Additionally the oligos should be desalted and resuspended in water as opposed to Tris EDTA (TE), which can interfere with subsequent amine-coupling reactions.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Coupling:</emphasis></para>
<para><emphasis>Note: When deciding whether to perform in-house coupling or order readily coupled probes, we suggest considering the following:</emphasis></para>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem><para><emphasis>Is it clear which fluorophore to choose? This could vary depending on probe set and the optical setup.</emphasis></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Is it necessary to split the probe sets to target different parts of a transcript? Pre-coupling requires mixing of all probes in a library, thus excluding the possibility of alternative probe combinations.</emphasis></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Is in-house coupling feasible? Is there access to a nearby HPLC facility?</emphasis></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Does experimental schedule allow an additional 3-4 days of probe preparation?</emphasis></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Is budget a concern? A single probe set of 10 nmol quantity can be coupled to multiple fluorophores (up to 3-4 coupling per probe set is possible), avoiding the need to purchase multiple libraries.</emphasis></para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>Prior to coupling, one needs to decide on the desired type of fluorophore. The current protocol uses succinimidyl ester derivatives to couple to the 3&#x2019; end of the oligonucleotide probes. Three types of commercially available fluorophores are commonly used: Cy5 (GE Amersham), Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), and tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Biosearch also offers equivalent fluorophores (Quasar 670, and CAL Fluor 610 and 590) for their couple probe sets. In general we have found that using fluorophores with shorter emission wavelengths (such as Alexa 488) does not yield reliable signal due to high cellular autofluorescence. <link linkend="table1">Table 1</link> summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of each of the fluorophores as observed in our hands.</para>

<para>For multiplexing assays, we have obtained good results with combinations of all three dyes (provided that each probe set works well when assayed on its own). We generally prefer to pair Cy5 with Alexa 594, as the two fluorophores tend to give better signal quality than TMR. For initial testing, it is important to compare results from multiplex and single-fluorophore assays to ensure consistency. Also keep an eye out for &#x201C;suspiciously similar&#x201D; spot patterns accross channels, which is indicative of cross-talk between fluorescent channels.</para>

<para><emphasis role="bold">What to expect:</emphasis> A successful hybridization and sample preparation should yield clear fluorescent spots roughly 200-500 nm in size. These spots are so called &#x201C;diffraction limited spots&#x201D; based on the fact that the size of an mRNA molecule (nm) is far below the optical limit of the widefield microscope (&#x03BC;m). On a digitally acquired smFISH image, spot intensities usually vary within 2 fold of one another (for the same gene detected in the same fluorescent channel), with the exception of transcription centers in the nuclei (where large amounts of nascent transcripts accumulate), which can be much brighter. Optimal smFISH signal should be more than 1.5 times in intensity above the tissue background. When viewed on an image, the spots should be distinct in shape (i.e., not blurred) and readily identifiable by eye. <link linkend="figure2">Figure 2</link> illustrates two smFISH experiments, one probing <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=elt-2;class=Gene" role="_blank">elt-2</ulink></emphasis> (a transcription factor involved in specifying the future intestine, <link linkend="bib2">Fukushige <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 1998</link><!--PMID: 9659934-->) in embryos (from <link linkend="bib9">Raj <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2010</link><!--PMID: 20164922-->), the other staining three Wnt ligands expressed in the posterior body of the L1 larvae (from <link linkend="bib3">Harterink <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2011</link><!--PMID: 21653614-->).</para>

<para>Successful smFISH experiments can simultaneously provide high quality information on the location, abundance, and transcriptional states of multiple mRNA species. To extract this wealth of information in an efficient and unbiased way, we recommend analyzing smFISH data using custom written computer software.

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Image segmentation:</emphasis> Image segmentation is a useful step in localizing mRNA expression to specific cell or tissue-types. Oftentimes, it is possible to take advantage of DAPI staining (for demarcating the body axes and major tissue groups, i.e., body wall muscles, ventral nerve cord, intestinal cells, etc.), GFP reporter systems, and smFISH signals (by staining for genes previously known to be expressed in a given cell or tissue) to accurately assign smFISH spots to their tissue of origin. Computational software can facilitate this process by overlaying images from multiple channels (e.g., Cy5, Alexa 594, GFP and DAPI), followed by manual or automatic annotation of the relevant spatial landmarks. These annotations can later be overlaid onto the smFISH images to allow tissue-specific transcript quantification. Additional analysis, such as measurement of tissue length or size, can also be performed computationally at this step. If performing segmentation using computational software (e.g., MATLAB), the resulting traces and annotations can be saved as a standalone data file and used for region-specific spot counting (step 5) later.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Image sharpening:</emphasis> To facilitate subsequent automatic spot detection, it is useful to first enhance the signal-to-noise contrast of the smFISH images. This can be done by convolving each image file (i.e., a matrix consisting of individual pixel values) with two mathematical functions (kernels), a Gaussian followed by a Laplacian. In practice the two functions can be convolved first to form a computational filter called the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG). As shown in <link linkend="figure4">Figure 4</link>, the effect of convolving the original image with the LoG filter is twofold: 1) the Gaussian filter smoothens the background to reduce small speckles that could be confused with real spots, 2) the Laplacian filter then performs edge detection by amplifying the contrast between adjacent dim and bright pixels. The width of the Gaussian filter should be picked to resemble the size of a typical spot. Alternatively, this can be done by trial and error (we recommend starting around 1.5) by visually comparing the filtered and original images. The following is an example of MATLAB code used for image sharpening:
<literallayout>
H = -fspecial('log',15,1.2); % H is the LoG filter with a standard deviation of 1.2 and width around 5
g = imfilter(im,H);    % im is the original smFISH image</literallayout></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Spot detection and semi-automated threshold picking:</emphasis> Since smFISH signals are significantly brighter than the background, individual spots are detected by identifying regions in the image with pixel values higher than a pre-specified threshold. One way of determining this threshold is to systematically screen threshold values in incremental steps from the minimum to the maximum pixel intensities. For each threshold value tested, the software identifies filled regions (or &#x201C;connected objects&#x201D;) wherein all pixel values are above threshold. The total number of filled regions is then summed up to yield the total spot count corresponding to the given threshold.</para>
<para>After spot detection and counting has been carried out for all thresholds, a plot can be generated showing total spot counts as a function of different threshold values. With high quality imaging data this curve is expected to start high and drop rapidly to reach a brief plateau, before it finally approaches zero (<link linkend="figure5">Figure 5</link>). The observed plateau corresponds to all threshold values above the background auto-fluorescence and below the real signal intensity. The total spot count is approximately constant in this range and corresponds reliably to the number of actual smFISH spots. Seemingly convenient, automatic detection of this plateau is sometimes difficult (since the size and flatness of this plateau varies from image to image). Especially during initial testing of the software, we recommend to manually pick the threshold, and plot the computationally detected spots over the original image to ensure that no over- or under-counting has occurred.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Region-specific spot counting:</emphasis> Spot quantification within a specific cell or tissue can be conveniently achieved by aligning the results from image segmentation and spot detection. Computationally this can be done by generating a binary map for the region of interest (ROI) and using this map to filter out detected spots that are outside the ROI. MATLAB&#x0027;s Image Processing Toolbox provides many built-in functions that can greatly facilitate the image analysis steps described here. A sample of such MATLAB based software is available at the Arjun Raj lab website <ulink url="http://rajlab.seas.upenn.edu/pdfs/raj_nat_meth_2008_software.zip">http://rajlab.seas.upenn.edu/pdfs/raj_nat_meth_2008_software.zip</ulink>. Additional details for using MATLAB to perform image processing and single-molecule identification can be found in a recent paper by <link linkend="bib12">Scott Rifkin (2011</link><!--PMID: 22065448-->).

<title>Controls and troubleshooting</title>
<para>As the power of smFISH method lies in the accurate detection of single mRNA molecules, it is important to perform proper controls for each new smFISH probe library generated. Here we outline a number of control experiments that address common concerns regarding smFISH results. Additionally, while the smFISH protocols described here worked robustly for many <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> genes (including Wnt and Notch pathway genes, endoderm specification genes, etc., in both worms and embryos), we did notice a number of technical factors that can affect data quality. We thus provide a list of troubleshooting tips below to facilitate further optimization of the protocols.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Recommended controls:</emphasis></para>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem><para><emphasis>Does a single smFISH spot represent a single mRNA molecule?</emphasis></para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Solution 1: To confirm single molecule resolution, one may randomly sample the peak pixel intensities of individual smFISH molecules within a given series of images (a process automatable by computer software). The spot intensities should then be plotted on a histogram. The resulting distribution is expected to be unimodal with one narrow peak (this would not be the case if mRNA molecules frequently occur as groups of two or more) (<link linkend="bib16">Vargas <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2005</link><!--PMID: 16284251-->). Large mRNA aggregates in the nucleus or specialized organelles (as in the case of transcription centers, P bodies and stress granules) are often many-fold brighter and can be easily excluded from analysis by pixel thresholding. To control for the rare case where mRNA of the same species dimerize (an example being the <emphasis>Drosophila</emphasis> <emphasis>bicoid</emphasis> mRNA, <link linkend="bib17">Wagner <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2004</link><!--PMID: 14607826-->), one may proceed to perform quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) as described below.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Solution 2: To independently check mRNA level, a control qRT-PCR experiment can be performed on bulk collected <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> tissue. As it is currently difficult to enrich for particular tissue or cell types in a bulk collection (with the exception of dissected gonads), this approach would only apply to whole worm or embryo measurement. qRT-PCR measurement from bulk collected tissue then needs to be normalized by the estimated total number of worms or embryos. The obtained average expression level per animal can then be compared to average smFISH measurements, and the two are expected to be largely consistent.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Are we robustly detecting all mRNA transcripts of a given species?</emphasis> (Positive control)</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Solution 1: Separate the uncoupled probe library into two halves containing non-overlapping sets of probes. Couple these two probe sets respectively with two different fluorophores and hybridize both probe sets to the same sample. If the majority of mRNA transcripts are reliably detected, most spots should appear double labeled, and the overall degree of co-localization should be high. We have consistently detected around 85% co-localization, suggesting the majority of the mRNA transcripts are being detected by smFISH. Additionally, it is recommended to partition the probe library in a way that allows probes with one fluorophore to interleave probes with the other fluorophore. Compared with having the two sets of probes targeting two different regions of the endogenous mRNA, this approach avoids differences in probe binding efficiency along different parts of the mRNA. A potential weakness is that this approach is non-robust for mRNAs that are inaccessible by the smFISH protocol (e.g., mRNAs that are localized in specialized organelles or embodied by protein complexes). The following approach provides an independent and complementary assessment of total mRNA quantity.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Solution 2: To determine whether the number of transcripts detected by smFISH is accurate, one may perform, in parallel, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) on a known number of synchronized worms. The total and average number of transcripts should agree between the two approaches. However this approach may not work well when transcript number within a specific tissue or region is of interest. qRT-PCR measurement is also subject to imperfect worm synchronization and may yield average counts that are lower or higher than the smFISH result (<link linkend="bib16">Vargas <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2005</link><!--PMID: 16284251-->, <link linkend="bib11">Raj <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> 2008</link><!--PMID: 18806792-->).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Are we detecting mRNA transcripts other than the species of interest?</emphasis> (Negative control)</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Solution: If possible, obtain a mutant strain with a large deletion in the coding sequence. Design probes that specifically target the deleted region, and hybridize the same probe set to both the wild-type strain and the mutant. While the probe should yield detectable signal in wild-type worms, no spots should be detected for the mutant. If a deletion allele is not available or the deletion is too short, consider using a strain harboring a nonsense mutation. Confirm first by RT-PCR that the mRNA is greatly reduced compared to the wild-type (likely resulting from nonsense-mediated decay). Then perform smFISH to confirm that similar reduction in transcripts is observed in the mutant.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>General note: When designing probes, it is good practice to blast the probe library against the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> genome to ensure that majority of the targeted sequences are unique (especially important when multiple paralogs exist in the genome). It is also important to keep the GC content of the probes around below 70% as GC rich probes are more prone to non-specific binding.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>How do we differentiate smFISH spots from auto-fluorescent speckles?</emphasis> (Negative control)</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Solution 1: Auto-fluorescent speckles tend to show up in multiple fluorescent channels while smFISH spots light up only in the channel determined by the coupled fluorophore. Overlay images from different fluorescent channels to differentiate auto-fluorescence from the real signal.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Solution 2: If auto-fluorescence is a strong concern, one may perform the hybridization procedure without adding the coupled probes. In the unlikely case that many fluorescent spots show up in the image, we know for sure that there is significant interfering signal from auto-fluorescence.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Is there bleed-through between channels (in the case of multi-color smFISH)?</emphasis></para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Solution: Bleed through between channels can happen when a signal in one channel is extremely strong. This is the case with intra-nuclear transcription centers, densely-packed transcripts (sometimes localized in organelles), and highly-over-expressed transgenes. To check for bleed-through, one may check if the spots detected in different channels (expected to represent two different transcript species) are highly co-localized. Alternatively, one may perform single-color FISH to see if spots are detected outside the expected channel. To avoid bleed-through choose channels that are as far apart in emission wavelength as possible and choose optical filters that separate well between the channels (<link linkend="table2">Table 2</link>).</para></listitem>

</orderedlist>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Troubleshooting tips:</emphasis></para>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem><para><emphasis>Low signal intensity or no signal</emphasis></para>
<para>Whenever possible, use a previously tested probe set (coupled to the same fluorophore) as positive control to make sure all equipment (light source, camera, software, etc.) are working properly. For issues specific to the particular probe set, consider checking the following:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>1) <emphasis>Probe concentration</emphasis>. Test higher concentrations (e.g., start with one order of magnitude higher) to see if the signal quality improves. Based on experience, we recommend diluting in TE 1:20 for Cy5 coupled probes, 1:50 for Alexa, and 1:10 for TMR, followed by 1:100 dilution in hybridization buffer.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>2) <emphasis>Tissue penetration</emphasis>. Make sure the sample has been incubated in EtOH for ample time (e.g., 24 hours).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>3) <emphasis>Hybridization stringency</emphasis>. Formamide concentration of the hybridization buffer directly controls binding efficiency. While 10% formamide generally works well for all <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> stages, one may try decreasing the concentration to see if signal improves. One should be cautious with this approach as low formamide concentration also ups the chance of non-specific binding.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>High fluorescent background</emphasis></para>
<para>Multiple causes are likely:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>1) <emphasis>Unhealthy worms</emphasis>. Starvation and over-crowded culture lead to high auto-fluorescence in the worm tissue. This is the most common cause of high background and should be avoided by proper worm culture maintenance.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>2) <emphasis>Over-fixation</emphasis>. The second common cause and especially problematic for older worms. Keep fixation time under an hour and adjust fixation duration to troubleshoot. Also make sure to thoroughly wash off the fixative with 1x PBS to terminate fixation.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>3) <emphasis>High probe concentration or insufficient washing</emphasis>. This can be checked by testing lower dilutions and incubating longer during the two wash steps.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>4) <emphasis>Low probe binding stringency</emphasis>. This could be a result of either low formamide concentration or high probe GC content. In both cases, probes bind non-specifically leading to increased background fluorescence. Unlike tissue auto-fluorescence, this phenomenon should be specific to the channel of the fluorophore whereas auto-fluorescence affects all channels.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>5) <emphasis>Out-of-focus light</emphasis>. Real FISH signals that are outside the focal plane appear as diffuse background fluorescence in the focal plane. This problem is often dramatically improved by sucking away any excess fluid in the imaging chamber and maximally flattening the sample.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Nonspecific signal (due to auto-fluorescence or bleed-through)</emphasis></para>
<para>First make sure that the sample is collected from a clean, healthy batch of worms to reduce overall background. Sometimes, signal in the Alexa 594 channel can bleed into the Cy5 channel if the two optical filters are not optimally separated in spectrum. Extremely high signal intensity (often in the case of over-expressed transgenes) in one channel can also broadly show up as &#x201C;pseudo-spots&#x201D; in multiple other channels. To check, test each probe set in a separate hybridization to see if problem persists.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Irregular or diffuse spot morphology interfering with spot identification and counting</emphasis></para>
<para>Successful smFISH experiment should yield spots circular in 2D and with sizes similar to one another. However liquid between the sample and the objective can obscure the expected optical properties of the spots. In such case, try to maximally flatten the sample to reduce sample thickness and out-of-focus light. Additionally, highly local spot density (which occurs with highly expressed genes or transgenes) can lead to inevitable difficulty in resolving individual spots. When processing through computational software, try to identify local maxima in addition to &#x201C;connected regions&#x201D;. This allows sub-diffraction detection of the (in principal) exact location of the mRNA transcript and thereby enhances the resolution of the smFISH signal.</para></listitem>
