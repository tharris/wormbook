<para>Threshold picking and automatic detection of smFISH spots. <emphasis role="bold">A.</emphasis> Total spot counts as a function of pixel intensity threshold. The correct threshold should be placed where the spot count is insensitive to threshold value (where the &#x201C;plateau&#x201D; is). <emphasis role="bold">B.</emphasis> Spot detection when correct threshold (solid vertical line in <emphasis role="bold">A</emphasis>) is chosen. Red circles indicate computationally identified spots for a single image from a stack. Note out-of-focus spots are not counted. <emphasis role="bold">C.</emphasis> Spot detection when threshold is chosen too low (dotted line in <emphasis role="bold">A</emphasis>). Note many out-of-focus spots and background speckles are mistakenly included as spots.</para>
