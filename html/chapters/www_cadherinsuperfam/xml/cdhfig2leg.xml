        <title>Figure 2. The organisation of the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> cadherin-catenin complex</title>
        <para>HMR-1A is depicted as forming a dimer, with the N-terminal extracellular cadherin domains of the dimer interacting with those of HMR-1A dimers on opposing cell membranes. This is based on models of the cadherin adhesion interface derived from structural studies of vertebrate classic cadherins. It is not clear if these models hold for the type III classic cadherins. This diagram is by necessity a simplified view; there are many more proteins associated with the CCC, but the details of how they associate with the complex are not fully understood. The domains are identified using the key in (<link linkend="figure1">Figure 1</link>). The PCCD is drawn to indicate the putative proteolytic cleavage site based upon sequence similarity to <emphasis>Drosophila</emphasis> E-cadherin.</para>
