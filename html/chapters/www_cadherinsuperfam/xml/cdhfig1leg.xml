        <title>Figure 1. Structural diversity of the cadherin superfamily in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis></title>
        <para>The 13 <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> cadherins are grouped according to their structural similarity with cadherins from other organisms. Each cadherin is positioned with its N-terminus to the left. PCCD = primitive classic cadherin domain (formerly termed non-chordate classic cadherin domain, it has also now been found in chordate classic cadherins).</para>
