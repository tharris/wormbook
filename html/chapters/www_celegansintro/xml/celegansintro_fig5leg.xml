<title>Figure 5</title><para><emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> tissue morphology. (A) Cross section of the outer layers of the animal showing muscle cells below the epidermis and cuticle viewed by transmission electron microscopy. (B) Single gonad arm dissected out of a hermaphrodite showing germ cell DNA (stained white). Meiosis begins in the region labeled Pachytene (upper right) and continues around the loop of the gonad until oocytes are formed. The stored sperm are located in the spermatheca of the gonad (bottom right). This image is a composite of 3 gonad arms and dashed lines represent regions not captured in the individual micrographs. (C) The anterior of the animal showing the mouth where food enters, the pharynx with its two bulbs, and the beginning of the intestine viewed with differential interference contrast (DIC). (D) A single body wall muscle cell with 6 muscle arms (marked with asterisks) extending to the ventral nerve cord (lateral view). The micrograph shows fluorescence from both muscle and neuronal GFP reporters [<emphasis role="italic">him-4p::MB::YFP</emphasis> (muscle), <emphasis role="italic">hmr-1b:: DsRed2</emphasis> (neuron) and <emphasis role="italic">unc-129nsp:: DsRed2</emphasis> (neuron)].
