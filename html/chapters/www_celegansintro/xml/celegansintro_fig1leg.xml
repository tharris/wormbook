<title>Figure 1</title><para>Observing <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans.</emphasis> (A) Petri dishes sitting on the base of a dissecting stereomicroscope. Bacterial lawns are visible on the surface of the agar inside the dishes but the <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> are too small to be seen in this view. (B) <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> viewed through the dissecting microscope. The two adults are moving in this view. Tracks in the plate indicate where animals have traveled on the bacterial lawn. (C) An adult hermaphrodite is viewed in a compound microscope. In all pictures, anterior is to the left and ventral is on the bottom. <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> moves on either its left or right side; in this image the surface facing the viewer is the left side. Because the animals are transparent, one can see, from left to right on the ventral side, developing oocytes in the gonad (rectangular cells with a clear, circular nucleus inside) followed by the spermatheca (where oocytes are fertilized), and multiple embryos in the uterus.
