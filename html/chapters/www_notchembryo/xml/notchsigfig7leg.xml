        <para>MSap descendants provide an inductive focus of Notch signaling on the left side of the
            embryo. Schematic diagram of a cross section through an embryo at successive time
            points. MS descendants are indicated with a bold black outline with the left,
            ligand-expressing cells shown in blue. LIN-12-expressing cells are outlined in red, and
            cells that undergo Notch signaling are filled with green. As
            gastrulation movements cause AB descendants to flow toward the ventral midline (arrows outside embryo), they
            come into contact with the ligand-expressing cell. </para>
