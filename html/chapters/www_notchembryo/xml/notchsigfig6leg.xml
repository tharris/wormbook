        <title>Figure 6. POP-1 asymmetry in AB descendant</title>
        <para>The left panel shows POP-1 expression in an embryo containing 32 AB descendants, and
            the right panel shows the same embryo stained with DAPI and an antibody that recognizes
            the midbody between sister cells (blue arrows). Note the high level of nuclear POP-1 in
            the most anterior sister of each pair in the left panel. The nuclear localization of
            POP-1 is cell cycle dependent and not seen during mitosis (large arrow in right panel
            indicates a dividing cell). The bottom panel shows a lineage diagram of AB descendants,
            with high nuclear POP-1 indicated by light blue and low nuclear POP-1 indicated by dark
            blue. Only the first few divisions of the AB descendants are shown. Adapted from <link linkend="bib41">Park and Priess (2003)</link>.</para>
