        <para>Schematic diagram of early blastomeres at the 2-cell, 4-cell, and 12-cell stages; the
            12-cell embryo is a ventral view with the AB descendants splayed to demonstrate cell
            contacts. For simplicity, AB descendants at the 12-cell stage such as ABala or ABarp are
            labeled "ala" and "arp". In this and other Figures, cells expressing GLP-1/Notch are
            outlined in red, and Notch-activated cells are shown first in light green, then dark
            green at later time points. </para>
