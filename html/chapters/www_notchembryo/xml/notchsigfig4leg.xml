        <para>Ventral view of 26-cell embryos showing expression of TBX-38 and a REF-1
            family member, HLH-29. At this stage there are eight ABa, and eight ABp, descendants. ABp descendants are
            induced to express HLH-29 and other REF-1 family members by the first Notch interaction,
            thus preventing TBX-38 expression in these cells. HLH-29 and a subset of other REF-1
            family members are expressed in EMS descendants (circled) independent of Notch, and
            similarly prevent TBX-38 expression. TBX-38 is expressed at high levels in all ABa
            descendants before the second Notch interaction induces high levels of the REF-1 family.
            The asterisk indicates an example of an ABa descendant that expresses TBX-38 but is not
            activated by Notch signaling. Adapted from <link linkend="bib57">Neves and Priess (2005)</link>.</para>
