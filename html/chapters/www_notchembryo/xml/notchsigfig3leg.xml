        <title>Figure 3. Model summarizing the various outputs of the first four Notch interactions in the AB lineage</title>
        <para>The first two interactions are mediated by GLP-1, and the second two require either
            LIN-12 and GLP-1. For example, the second interaction (mediated by GLP-1) activates the
            expression of LIN-12/Notch, but represses the expression of LAG-2/Delta. Although the
            <emphasis>tbx-37</emphasis>, <emphasis>-38</emphasis> genes appear to be direct targets
            of REF-1 family members, it is not known whether other examples of repression are direct
            or indirect. Adapted from <link linkend="bib57">Neves and Priess (2005)</link>.</para>
