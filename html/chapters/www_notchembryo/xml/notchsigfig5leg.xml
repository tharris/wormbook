        <title>Figure 5. Notch signaling and head development</title>
        <para>The top four panels show embryos as listed that were stained to visualize adherens
            junctions surrounding the hypodermal (skin) cells on the surface (see <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_epidermalmorphogenesis/epidermalmorphogenesis.html" role="_blank">Epidermal morphogenesis</ulink>). The right side of the <emphasis>lin-12 glp-1</emphasis>
            mutant is similar to wild-type embryos; the H0 and H1 hypodermal cells produced by the
            right head precursor are indicated with asterisks. Note that these cells are not
            produced by the left head precursor in this embryo, nor are they produced on the left
            side of <emphasis>lag-1</emphasis> or <emphasis>lag-2</emphasis> mutant embryos. The
            bottom panels show a dorsal view of a wild-type embryo with the granddaughters of the
            left and right head precursors indicated. Both sets of granddaughters normally express
            REF-1, however killing the ligand-expressing cell for the third Notch interaction blocks
            expression only in the left cells. Adapted from <link linkend="bib40">Moskowitz and Rothman (1996)</link>; <link linkend="bib57">Neves and Priess (2005)</link>.</para>
