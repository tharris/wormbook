        <para>Representation of the male tail over the hermaphrodite vulval region. (A) Contact with
            the hermaphrodite vulva initiates insertion behavior. (B) Spicules repeatedly prod the
            vulval slit. Arrows and variably shaded spicules denote repetitive shallow thrusting
            motions. (C) Partial penetration of the spicules signals prodding to stop and induces
            full insertion. Arrow denotes downward motion of the spicules. (D) Spicules stay
            inserted until ejaculation is over.</para>
