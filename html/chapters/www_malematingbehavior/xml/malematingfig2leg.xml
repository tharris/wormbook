        <title>Figure 2. Male sensory neurons associated with mating behavior</title>
        <para>Cartoon adapted from <link linkend="bib24">Sulston et al. (1980)</link> depicting the positions of ray neurons (A)
            and hook and postcloacal sensilla (p.c.s.) and SPC neurons (B). In panel A, the male
            tail has 9 bilaterally arranged rays numbered 1-9 anterior to posterior, (only one side
            is shown). Each ray contains the sensory dendritic process of an A type neuron and a B
            type neuron. Ray neurons are labeled according to what neuronal type they are, and with
            which rays they are associated. In panel B, sensory dendritic processes of the <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=HOA;class=Cell" role="_blank">HOA</ulink> and
            <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=HOB;class=Cell" role="_blank">HOB</ulink> neurons (asymmetrically located on the left side of the animal) and the p.c.s.
            neurons (a left/right bilateral set of three neurons) are associated with the cloacal
            opening. The SPC proprioceptive neuron is physically associated with the spicule
            protractor muscles.</para>
