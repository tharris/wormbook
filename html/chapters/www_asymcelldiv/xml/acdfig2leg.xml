        <title>Figure 2. AP polarity and spindle positioning in one-cell stage embryos</title>
            <para>Centrosomes: black discs; microtubules: black lines; chromosomes, pronuclei and nuclei: gray ovals and discs; NMY-2: green network and foci; cortical PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3: red; cortical PAR-2 and PAR-1: blue; cortical GPR-1/2: green; cortical LET-99: gold. Note that the levels of GPR-1/2 and LET-99 increase during the cell cycle; for simplicity, LET-99 is shown as a band, but lower levels are present throughout the remaining cortex. Cortical force generators are represented with empty rectangles, the net pulling force acting on each spindle pole with red arrows. Four successive time-points are shown. (A) Shortly after fertilization, the whole cortex undergoes surface contractions and the network of cortical NMY-2 spans the entire embryo. Physical interaction between the centrosome and the posterior cortex breaks the symmetry of the oocyte and initiates AP polarity establishment. (B) Surface contractions cease in the presumptive posterior and a smoother cortical area expands anteriorly to approximately 50% egg-length. Concomitantly, the NMY-2 network contracts while moving towards the anterior. During this time, GFP-PAR-2 expands towards the anterior, whereas GFP-PAR-6 retracts from the posterior, both to approximately 50% egg-length. Note that centrosomes have duplicated at this stage and that they nucleate numerous astral microtubules. (C) Following pronuclear migration and meeting, the centrosomes and pronuclei move as a unit towards the cell center, while rotating by 90<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> such that centrosomes become aligned with the AP axis. (D) During mitosis, unequal net pulling forces act on the two spindle poles, with larger pulling forces acting on the posterior spindle pole.</para>
