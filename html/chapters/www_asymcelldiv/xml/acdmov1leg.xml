             <para>Embryo carrying a GFP-histone2B fusion protein (Strome et al., 2001) imaged using dual time-lapse differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy from the one-cell stage until the four-cell stage. One image was captured every ten seconds, and the movie is played back at 10 frames per seconds (overall, 100 times faster than actual events). The DIC and GFP signal (pseudocolored in green) are overlaid. The embryo is approximately 50 <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03BC;</symbol>m long and anterior is to the left.</para>
