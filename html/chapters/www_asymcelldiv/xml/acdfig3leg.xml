         <title>Figure 3. Sequential relationships between AP polarity components in one-cell stage embryos</title>
            <para>Contact between the centrosome and the cortex breaks the symmetry of the zygote and results in PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 receding from the posterior in an NMY-2-dependent manner. Meanwhile,  PAR-2 enrichment at the posterior occurs concomitant with that of PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 at the anterior. In turn, PAR-1 prevents MEX-5/6 accumulation at the posterior. The presence of MEX-5/6 at the anterior prevents the presence of P granules and PIE-1 on that side of the embryo, and also reinforces anterior PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 distribution. As a result of this sequence of interactions, P granules and PIE-1 are segregated to the posterior of one-cell stage embryos.</para>
