<title>Figure 1. Generation of founder cells in the early embryo</title>
<para>Anterior is to the left, posterior to the right, dorsal is up and ventral down in this and all subsequent figures. The germ-line precursors (P cells) are shown outlined with blue. Each of the founder cells generated by asymmetric division are indicated with a different color. The founder cells each display a characteristic cell cycle rate and lineage: The AB lineage produces hypodermis, neurons, anterior pharynx and other cell types; MS produces the somatic gonad, muscle, the majority of the pharynx, neurons and gland cells; E produces all intestine; C produces muscle, hypodermis and neurons; D produces muscle; P<subscript>4</subscript> is the germ-line precursor. The 16-cell embryo shown in (E) is simplified and does not show the daughters of the 4<superscript>th</superscript> AB cell division, which occurs at approximately the same time as the P<subscript>3</subscript> division.</para>
