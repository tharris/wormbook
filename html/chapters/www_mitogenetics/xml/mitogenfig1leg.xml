        <para>The molecule contains the genes for twelve proteins (thick grey arrows), two rRNAs
            (black arrows), and 22 tRNAs (circles labeled with one-letter amino acid code). The
            serine and leucine tRNAs are also identified by the codon family recognized. The
            positions of the putative D-loop and of the <emphasis>uaDf5</emphasis> deletion mutation are indicated inside and outside the circle, respectively.</para>
