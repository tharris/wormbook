        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>The mitochondrial genome is indispensable to the cellular and organismal biology of <emphasis>Caenorhabditis elegans</emphasis>. An elaborate cellular machinery is
            employed to maintain mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), to express it, and to ensure its
            inheritance. Because it is maternally transmitted and because of its wide-ranging copy
            number (it can be present at fewer than 100 to tens of thousands of copies per cell),
            the genetics of mtDNA are characterized by a number of peculiar and as yet incompletely
            understood features. The fundamental importance of mtDNA to cellular energy metabolism
            explains the profound effects mtDNA mutations can have; mitochondria are the major
            source of reactive oxygen species, which are implicated in premature aging and senescence.</para>
            <para>Mitochondria play a pivotal role in cellular metabolism. They were once free-living
            organisms related to modern eubacteria and they continue to perform many of the
            biochemical and physiological functions of their bacterial ancestors (<link linkend="bib37">Timmis et al., 2004</link><!-- : PMID 14735123 -->). Mitochondria are double-membrane organelles
            most commonly associated with oxidative phosphorylation, a process that meets the
            majority of cellular energy demands. In addition, mitochondria are involved in heme,
            lipid, nucleotide, iron-sulfur cluster, and amino acid biosynthesis: they are home to
            the citric acid cycle, the urea cycle and fatty acid oxidation.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
        <title>Mitochondrial DNA structure</title>
        <para> Mitochondria harbor a small but essential component of an eukaryote's genetic
            material. The symbiotic relationship that marks the origin of eukaryotes was established
            approximately 2 billion years ago and has been followed by a massive loss or transfer of
            genes to the host genome; only a tiny fraction (less than one percent) of the
            endosymbiont's genome is retained on the mtDNA (<link linkend="bib12">Gray et al., 2001</link><!-- : PMID 11423013 -->). Animal mtDNAs are extremely compact, being less than 20
            kilobases in length, and encode fewer than 40 genes (<link linkend="bib44">Wolstenholme, 1992</link><!-- : PMID 1452431 -->). All of the proteins encoded by the mtDNA are subunits of the
            mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC; <link linkend="bib30">Okimoto et al., 1992</link><!-- : PMID 1551572 -->). Despite their small number, the genes on the mtDNA necessitate a
            large expenditure of cellular resources because they are essential for strict aerobes.
            Hundreds of nuclear genes are needed to replicate, transcribe, and maintain the
            mitochondrial chromosome and to assemble the translation machinery needed to express its
            dozen or so proteins (<link linkend="bib41">Tsang and Lemire, 2003</link><!-- : PMID 12853115 -->).</para>
        <para>The <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> mtDNA is 13,794 nucleotides in length and encodes
            36 genes: 2 ribosomal RNAs (12S rRNA and 16S rRNA), 22 transfer RNAs, and 12 MRC
            subunits (<xref linkend="figure1" />; <link linkend="bib30">Okimoto et al., 1992</link><!-- : PMID 1551572 -->).
                      A typical animal mtDNA, the nematode mitochondrial genome is slightly smaller than its human counterpart. It lacks the ATP8 gene of the human genome, which encodes a subunit of the ATP synthase (complex V). Introns are absent and there are few or no non-coding nucleotides between
            genes; approximately 92<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x0025;</symbol> of the mitochondrial genome has coding function. Three genes
            end with incomplete termination codons (T or TA) that are apparently converted to TAA
            codons by polyadenylation of the transcript. Only one sizeable non-coding region called
            the displacement loop or D-loop is present. The replication and transcription of mtDNA
            has been mainly studied in mammals where the D-loop region contains one of the origins
            of replication and the promoters for mtDNA transcription (<link linkend="bib8">Garesse and Vallejo, 2001</link><!-- : PMID 11223238 -->). Few components needed for the maintenance or
            expression of the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> mtDNA have been experimentally
            identified. The <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/protein?name=CLK-1;class=protein" role="_blank">CLK-1</ulink> (biological clock abnormal) protein was reported to have DNA binding activity specific for the light strand origin of replication (O<subscript>L</subscript>) on the mtDNA,
            suggesting a role in regulating mtDNA replication or transcription in <emphasis>C.
                elegans</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib10">Gonz&#x000E1;lez-Halphen et al., 2004</link><!-- : PMID 15247021 -->; <link linkend="bib11">Gorbunova and Seluanov, 2002</link><!--: PMID -->).</para>

        <para>In contrast to the relatively uniform gene content of metazoan mtDNAs, the
            mitochondrial genetic codes are highly modified. In <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, TGA
            specifies tryptophan rather than being a stop codon, ATA specifies methionine rather
            than iso-leucine, and AGA and AGG specify serine rather than arginine. The translation
            initiation codon ATG is not used; ATT, ATA, or TTG codons apparently serve as initiation
            codons (<link linkend="bib30">Okimoto et al., 1992</link><!-- : PMID 1551572 -->; <link linkend="bib31">Okimoto et al., 1990</link><!-- : PMID 2235493 -->). These peculiarities of the genetic code may in
            part explain the retention of the twelve protein-coding genes on the mtDNA rather than
            their transfer to the nucleus.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
        <title>mtDNA-encoded proteins</title>
        <para>The <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> mtDNA encodes 12 MRC subunits out of a total of
            the approximately 80 subunits assembled into five MRC complexes (<xref linkend="figure2" />). Four of these five complexes contain mtDNA-encoded subunits; complex II, the
            succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, is the exception. The ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4,
            ND4L, ND5, and ND6 subunits of complex I (the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) are all
            core subunits localized in the membrane arm of the enzyme. The ND1 subunit is implicated
            in ubiquinone binding (<link linkend="bib33">Schultz and Chan, 2001</link><!-- : PMID 11340051 -->). The
            cytochrome <emphasis>b</emphasis> of complex III (the ubiquinol-cytochrome c
            oxidoreductase) is encoded by the <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=ctb-1" role="_blank">ctb-1</ulink></emphasis> gene in <emphasis>C.
                elegans</emphasis>; it is an essential component of the enzyme, harboring 2
                <emphasis>b</emphasis>-type hemes. Similarly, the COI, COII, and COIII subunits,
            which coordinate catalytic heme and copper cofactors, are essential components of
            complex IV (the cytochrome <emphasis>c</emphasis> oxidase). Finally, the ATP6 subunit of complex V plays a vital role in the efficiency of ATP synthesis (<link linkend="bib25">Lenaz et al., 2004</link><!-- : PMID 15282179 -->). Not surprisingly, mutations in each of the human
            orthologs are causal in a variety of neurological, endocrinological, and muscular
        diseases (<link linkend="bib5">DiMauro, 2004</link><!-- : PMID 15282178 -->).</para>

        <para>Very few mutations in the nematode mtDNA have been reported. In contrast, over 100
            point mutations and 200 insertions, deletions, or rearrangements have been described for
            the human mtDNA (see <ulink url="http://www.mitomap.org" role="_blank">MITOMAP: A Human Mitochondrial Genome Database</ulink>). It is puzzling why mtDNA mutations have not been reported in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, given the large number of genetic screens for defects in motility, reproduction, development, and other functions. Perhaps the nematode can better tolerate deleterious mtDNA mutations or has mechanisms to prevent their transmission. The genetics of the mitochondrial genome still offer much to
            be explored.</para>

        <title>Mitochondrial DNA inheritance</title>
        <para>It is generally believed that animal mtDNA is inherited exclusively from the mother.
            However, it was recently shown in a patient with mitochondrial myopathy that the
            pathogenic mtDNA was of paternal origin (<link linkend="bib34">Schwartz and Vissing, 2002</link><!-- : PMID 12192017 -->). Evidence for the occasional paternal transmission of mtDNA has
            also been reported in sheep, mice, cattle, mussels, and insects (<link linkend="bib46">Zhao et al., 2004</link><!-- : PMID 15266295 -->). Although rare, the paternal inheritance of mtDNA
            may have a significant impact on evolution and on disease development.</para>

    <sect1>
        <title>Mitochondrial dynamics</title>
        <para>Mitochondria are dynamic structures and organelle plasticity is related to mtDNA
            inheritance (<link linkend="bib9">Garrido et al., 2003</link><!-- : PMID 12686611 -->). Multiple mtDNA
            molecules are organized into discrete protein-DNA complexes called nucleoids
                (<link linkend="bib19">Jacobs et al., 2000</link><!-- : PMID 10842310 -->). Mitochondria form
            reticular or tubular networks and their interaction with cytoskeletal components
            provides clues to their distribution, movement, and inheritance (<link linkend="bib32">Rube and van der Bliek, 2004</link><!-- : PMID 14977192 -->). A mutation in the
            <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=anc-1" role="_blank">anc-1</ulink></emphasis> (anchorage of nuclei abnormal) gene of <emphasis>C.
            elegans</emphasis> resulted in hypodermal nuclei and mitochondria that float freely in
            the cytoplasm of syncytial cells (<link linkend="bib15">Hedgecock and Thomson, 1982</link><!-- : PMID 6889924 -->). These mitochondria adopted an almost spherical shape and were often
            clustered. <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/protein?name=ANC-1;class=protein" role="_blank">ANC-1</ulink> contains several coiled coil regions, a nuclear envelope localization
            domain, and an actin-binding domain, suggesting it mediates connections from nuclei and
            mitochondria to the actin network and to the nuclear envelope (<link linkend="bib36">Starr and Han, 2002</link><!-- : PMID 12169658 -->). Mitochondrial division is required to regulate
            organelle numbers during cell division, differentiation, and in response to
            environmental conditions. The <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/protein?name=DRP-1;class=protein" role="_blank">DRP-1</ulink>, a dynamin-related
            protein with a characteristic GTPase domain, plays a key role in mitochondrial
            distribution and division (<link linkend="bib22">Labrousse et al., 1999</link><!-- : PMID 10619028 -->).
            RNAi of <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=drp-1" role="_blank">drp-1</ulink></emphasis> results in embryonic lethality and abnormal
            mitochondrial morphology and distribution, while overexpression leads to fragmentation
            of the organelle. <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/protein?name=DRP-1;class=protein" role="_blank">DRP-1</ulink> is involved in the fission of the mitochondrial outer membrane,
            perhaps directly or perhaps through its ability to recruit additional fission machinery
            components.</para>

    <sect1>
        <title>mtDNA copy number</title>
        <para>The numbers of mitochondria and mitochondrial genomes in a cell are regulated and can
            vary substantially between tissues (<link linkend="bib29">Moraes, 2001</link><!-- : PMID 11275325 -->).
            The developmental regulation of mtDNA copy numbers in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>
            has been investigated (<link linkend="bib39">Tsang and Lemire, 2002</link><!-- : PMID 11829454 -->). An
            embryo contains <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>25,000 copies of mtDNA and this number remains unchanged through the
            L1, L2, and L3 larval stages. A fivefold increase to 1.3 x
            10<superscript>5</superscript> copies in the L4 stage is followed by a further sixfold
            increase to 7.8 x 10<superscript>5</superscript> copies in the adult hermaphrodite. The
            first copy number increase coincides with sexual maturation; spermatogenesis begins in
            the early L4 stage and oogenesis in the young adult.</para>
        <para>mtDNA copy number is closely tied to reproduction. Mutations in the
            <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=glp-1" role="_blank">glp-1</ulink></emphasis> gene, which is involved in <emphasis role="underline">g</emphasis>erm <emphasis role="underline">l</emphasis>ine <emphasis role="underline">p</emphasis>roliferation, lead to
            an almost complete absence of germ line cells while somatic cell numbers are normal
                (<link linkend="bib1">Austin and Kimble, 1987</link><!-- : PMID 3677168 -->). The mtDNA content of
            an L4-stage <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=glp-1" role="_blank">glp-1</ulink></emphasis> hermaphrodite is <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>70,000, half of wild type
            levels (<link linkend="bib39">Tsang and Lemire, 2002</link><!-- : PMID 11829454 -->). There is no further
            increase in mtDNA copy number as the <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=glp-1" role="_blank">glp-1</ulink></emphasis> animal matures. Thus,
            increases in mtDNA content from the L3 to the adult stages can be subdivided into two
            components: a somatic component is <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=glp-1" role="_blank">glp-1</ulink></emphasis> independent and occurs
            during development from the L3 (<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>25,000 copies) to the L4 stage (<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>70,000 in the
                <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=glp-1" role="_blank">glp-1</ulink></emphasis> L4) and a germ line component accounts for the remainder
            of the increase to 7.8 x10<superscript>5</superscript> in the adult.</para>
        <para>Oocyte production accounts for the majority of the germ line-related increases in
            mtDNA copy numbers. A loss of function mutation in the <emphasis role="underline">fem</emphasis>inization gene
            <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=fem-1" role="_blank">fem-1</ulink></emphasis> blocks sperm production in the hermaphrodite but does not
            affect mtDNA contents in the L4 or in the adult (<link linkend="bib39">Tsang and Lemire, 2002</link><!-- : PMID 11829454 -->). In contrast, a gain of function mutation in the
                <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=fem-3" role="_blank">fem-3</ulink></emphasis> gene, which blocks oocyte production, does not affect L4
            mtDNA content but reduces the content in the adult to about one quarter (to 1.9 x
                10<superscript>5</superscript> copies) of wild type levels. Thus, the majority of
            organellar genomes are associated with oocyte development and the sperm-associated
            component is minor. When determined independently, 18,000 copies of mtDNA were measured
            per <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=fem-1" role="_blank">fem-1</ulink></emphasis> oocyte, a number similar to wild type embryos and early
            larvae.</para>
        <para>The mtDNA content of individual <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> cells is considerably
            lower than the estimated values of 1,000-10,000 copies per cell in higher eukaryotes
                (<link linkend="bib39">Tsang and Lemire, 2002</link><!-- : PMID 11829454 -->). The <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>25,000 copies of
            mtDNA in the L1 larva, if evenly distributed around the 558 nuclei, suggest an average
            of 45 copies per cell. Similarly, the L4 larva has <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>1,000 somatic nuclei and 70,000
            copies of mtDNA in a <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=glp-1" role="_blank">glp-1</ulink></emphasis> mutant, corresponding to 70 copies per
            cell. It remains to be determined whether different somatic cells or tissues have
            distinct mitochondrial genome contents that might reflect their energy requirements.
            Estimated cellular contents of mtDNA for undifferentiated germ line cells and for sperm
            are 250 and 30-40, respectively. The increases in mtDNA copy numbers during development
            are suggestive of parallel increases in the numbers of organelles, although this has not
            been documented. Interestingly, there is an increase in organelle number and in the
            frequency of organelle division with a shift of temperature from 15 to 25&#x000B0;C (<link linkend="bib22">Labrousse et al., 1999</link><!-- : PMID 10619028 -->). This increased content of mitochondria may reflect an adaptation
            to the higher metabolic demands of elevated temperatures. Consistent with this notion,
            respiration rates (<link linkend="bib43">Van Voorhies and Ward, 1999</link><!-- : PMID 10500188 -->) and
            ubiquinone levels (<link linkend="bib21">Jonassen et al., 2002</link><!-- : PMID 12324451 -->) are
            doubled with similar temperature shifts.</para>

            Mutations in nuclear genes encoding MRC subunits such as <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=nuo-1" role="_blank">nuo-1</ulink></emphasis> or

            characteristic L3 stage arrest having an L2-staged gonad (<link linkend="bib41">Tsang and Lemire, 2003</link><!-- : PMID 12853115 -->; <link linkend="bib42">Tsang et al., 2001</link><!-- : PMID 11410594 -->). Similarly, <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=clk-1" role="_blank">clk-1</ulink></emphasis> mutations, which impair
            ubiquinone biosynthesis, can lead to an L2 or L3-stage arrest (<link linkend="bib16">Hihi et al., 2002</link><!-- : PMID 11706003 -->; <link linkend="bib20">Jonassen et al., 2001</link><!-- : PMID 11136229 -->). Inhibitors of mtDNA replication or transcription such as ethidium
            bromide or inhibitors of mitochondrial translation such as chloramphenicol or
            doxycycline can also quantitatively produce an L3 stage developmental arrest
                (<link linkend="bib39">Tsang and Lemire, 2002</link><!-- : PMID 11829454 -->; <link linkend="bib42">Tsang et al., 2001</link><!-- : PMID 11410594 -->). Maturation to the L4 stage likely entails increased
            energy demands that are met with de novo synthesis of new mitochondrial energy
            production capacity. An energy sensor that responds to the concentrations of one or more
            metabolites, such as ATP or NADH, may communicate information about the status of
            mitochondrial energy generation and lead to altered patterns of MRC gene expression

        <title>mtDNA mutations</title>
        <para>Mitochondrial genetics differ from nuclear genetics in three aspects. First,
            mitochondrial genes are maternally inherited; they do not follow a Mendelian pattern of
            inheritance. Second, the mitochondrial genome is polyploid. Normally, a state of
            homoplasmy exists where only one form of mtDNA is present. Mutation can lead to a state
            of heteroplasmy where two or more forms of mtDNA coexist within a cell. Third, unlike a
            diploid nuclear gene that can normally only assume three states (homozygous wild type,
            heterozygous, or homozygous mutant), mtDNA heteroplasmy does not vary by discrete steps.
            The proportions of mtDNA species can vary with time or through mitotic segregation as
            cells divide.</para>
        <para>The inheritance and maintenance of mtDNA species are most poorly understood in the
            heteroplasmic condition. The <emphasis>uaDf5</emphasis> mtDNA deletion, which removes 11
            genes (four MRC subunit and seven tRNA genes), is maternally inherited and stably
            propagated without selection (<xref linkend="figure1" />; <link linkend="bib40">Tsang and Lemire, 2002</link><!-- : PMID 12440704 -->). While individual
            animals have <emphasis>uaDf5</emphasis> mtDNA contents ranging from <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>20<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x0025;</symbol> to <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>80<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x0025;</symbol>, the
            population average is <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>60<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x0025;</symbol> and this value does not vary between larval stages. There is
            no phenotype associated with the deletion, even in animals with an <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>80<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x0025;</symbol> content of
                <emphasis>uaDf5</emphasis> mtDNA. Most surprisingly, homoplasmic wild type or mutant
            animals have not been detected in over 100 generations, suggesting the two forms of
            mtDNA do not segregate from each other. Single, self-fertilized hermaphrodites with
            intermediate levels of <emphasis>uaDf5</emphasis> mtDNA (<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>50-60<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x0025;</symbol>) have offspring
            containing from 20-80<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x0025;</symbol> mutant mtDNA, indicating that the level of heteroplasmy can
            change significantly in one generation. However, hermaphrodites with extreme levels of
            heteroplasmy (<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>20<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x0025;</symbol> or <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x223C;</symbol>80<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x0025;</symbol>) only produce offspring with more moderate levels, suggesting
            two opposing forces are in operation. One force increases <emphasis>uaDf5</emphasis>
            contents when they are low, while the second decreases them when they are high. One
            possible explanation for this phenomenon is that wild type mtDNA contains an undetected
            mutation that is complemented by the <emphasis>uaDf5</emphasis> mtDNA. Thus, both
            genomes are needed to produce a fully functional MRC and homoplasmy for either mutation
            would be severely compromising or lethal. Alternatively, the stable heteroplasmy may
            result from intra-mitochondrial heteroplasmy, a condition where the mtDNA species are
            intermixed within the nucleoid of one organelle (<link linkend="bib19">Jacobs et al., 2000</link><!-- : PMID 10842310 -->).</para>
        <para>Although the heteroplasmic <emphasis>uaDf5</emphasis> animals do not have a phenotype,
            they have adjusted their mtDNA contents. Both hermaphrodites and males have
            approximately twice the number of mitochondrial genomes as their wild type counterparts
                (<link linkend="bib40">Tsang and Lemire, 2002</link><!-- : PMID 12440704 -->). The upregulation of
            mtDNA copy number may in part compensate for the effects of the mutation by enhancing
            the production of functional mitochondrial transcripts and/or proteins. Understanding
            the signals and mechanisms employed to regulate mtDNA copy number remains an important
            challenge.</para>
        <para>The <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> mtDNA mutation rate has been estimated using a
            series of mutation accumulation lines maintained by single-progeny descent for over 200
            generations (<link linkend="bib2">Denver et al., 2000</link><!-- : PMID 11009418 -->). In over 770,000
            base pairs of sequenced DNA, 16 base substitution and 10 insertion/deletion mutations
            were detected, corresponding to a measured rate approximately 100-fold higher than
            previous indirect estimates. Four of the insertion/deletion mutations introduced drastic
            changes to coding sequences, were homoplasmic (or nearly so), but had only modest
            effects on fitness. Most spontaneous mtDNA mutations in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>
            appear to be mildly deleterious although selection may occur in a natural context.</para>
        <para>The mtDNA mutation rate can be increased by environmental agents or by mutation of
            nuclear genes involved in mtDNA maintenance. For example, nucleoside analogs used in the
            clinical treatment of viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus, inhibit
            the mtDNA polymerase, which is essential for mtDNA synthesis and repair
                (<link linkend="bib26">Martin et al., 2003</link><!-- : PMID 12587093 -->). A mutation that impairs
            the fidelity of the mtDNA polymerase produced a mtDNA mutator phenotype in a mouse
            model; this was associated with premature aging and reduced lifespan
                (<link linkend="bib38">Trifunovic et al., 2004</link><!-- : PMID 15164064 -->).</para>

        <title>mtDNA and aging</title>
        <para>Mitochondrial functions influence and possibly control the rate of aging
                (<link linkend="bib4">Dillin et al., 2002</link><!-- : PMID 12471266 -->) and conversely, aging
            affects the integrity of the mitochondrial genome. An increased production of reactive
            oxygen species, often associated with MRC dysfunction, can precipitate premature aging,
            cause mutations in the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, and shorten lifespan
                (<link linkend="bib13">Hartman et al., 2004</link><!-- : PMID 15178131 -->). The first <emphasis>C.
                elegans</emphasis> mtDNA deletions detected were spontaneous events in an aging,
            wild type population (<link linkend="bib27">Melov et al., 1994</link><!-- : PMID 8152911 -->;
                <link linkend="bib28">Melov et al., 1995</link><!-- : PMID 7753635 -->). <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=age-1" role="_blank">age-1</ulink></emphasis>
            (aging abnormal) mutants, which are more resistant to oxidative stress and live twice
            as long as wild type, have a lower frequency of mtDNA deletions (<link linkend="bib28">Melov et al., 1995</link><!-- : PMID 7753635 -->). It has not been determined whether these
            aging-associated mtDNA deletions reduce fitness or whether they are heritable.</para>
        <para>To date, there is no direct evidence linking genes encoded by mtDNA with aging, but
            mutations in nuclear genes provide ample reason to believe that they are involved. The
                <emphasis>isp-1(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=qm150;class=Variation" role="_blank">qm150</ulink>)</emphasis> mutation, which affects the iron sulfur protein of
            complex III, was the first mutation of an MRC subunit reported to increase lifespan
                (<link linkend="bib7">Feng et al., 2001</link><!-- : PMID 11709184 -->). The mtDNA-localized,
            maternally-inherited <emphasis>ctb-1(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=qm189;class=Variation" role="_blank">qm189</ulink>)</emphasis> mutation affecting the cytochrome
                <emphasis>b</emphasis> subunit of complex III, does not alter the long life span of
                <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=qm150;class=Variation" role="_blank">qm150</ulink></emphasis> animals but does partially suppress other effects of the
                <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=qm150;class=Variation" role="_blank">qm150</ulink></emphasis> mutation (<link linkend="bib7">Feng et al., 2001</link><!-- : PMID 11709184 -->). The <emphasis>ctb-1(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=qm189;class=Variation" role="_blank">qm189</ulink>)</emphasis> mutation has no independent
            phenotype. The genetic interaction of the <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=isp-1" role="_blank">isp-1</ulink></emphasis> and
            <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=ctb-1" role="_blank">ctb-1</ulink></emphasis> mutations clearly illustrates the interplay of the
            mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in cellular metabolism. The
            <emphasis>mev-1(kn1)</emphasis> mutation is a missense allele of the
            <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=cyt-1" role="_blank">cyt-1</ulink></emphasis> gene encoding the cytochrome<emphasis> b</emphasis> subunit
            of complex II. Mutants are hypersensitive to methyl viologen and oxidative stress, have
            elevated levels of superoxide anion production, display signs of premature aging, have a
            reduced lifespan, and are hypermutable (<link linkend="bib14">Hartman et al., 2001</link><!-- : PMID 11389932 -->; <link linkend="bib17">Ishii et al., 1998</link><!-- : PMID 9716135 -->;
                <link linkend="bib18">Ishii et al., 2002</link><!-- : PMID 12374613 -->; <link linkend="bib35">Senoo-Matsuda et al., 2001</link><!-- : PMID 11527963 -->). A probable null mutation in the gene for the
            mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase <emphasis>(lrs-2(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=mg312;class=Variation" role="_blank">mg312</ulink>))</emphasis> markedly
            extends life span (<link linkend="bib23">Lee et al., 2003</link><!-- : PMID 12447374 -->). The synthetase
            charges mitochondrial tRNAs needed for the translation of the 12 mtDNA-encoded MRC
            subunits. Mutation of the gene encoding the isopentenyl-pyrophosphate:tRNA transferase
                <emphasis>(gro-1(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=e2400;class=Variation" role="_blank">e2400</ulink>)</emphasis>, abnormal growth rate), produces a Clk
            (biological clock abnormal) phenotype characterized by slow development and increased
            lifespan (<link linkend="bib24">Lemieux et al., 2001</link><!-- : PMID 11560893 -->). The apparent use of
            alternative translation initiation codons produces differentially targeted forms of
            <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/protein?name=GRO-1;class=protein" role="_blank">GRO-1</ulink>; it is the loss of the mitochondria-targeted form, which presumably modifies a
            subset of tRNAs and affects mitochondrial translation, that leads to the Clk phenotype.</para>
        <para>Non-genetic interventions that affect mitochondrial function can also affect aging.
            Systematic RNAi screens for increased lifespan have identified numerous mitochondrial
            components, including MRC subunits, mitochondrial carrier proteins, a subunit of the
            mitochondrial ribosome, and a protein involved in MRC biogenesis (<link linkend="bib4">Dillin et al., 2002</link><!-- : PMID 12471266 -->; <link linkend="bib23">Lee et al., 2003</link><!-- : PMID 12447374 -->). Mutations in the <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=clk-1" role="_blank">clk-1</ulink></emphasis> gene disrupt
            ubiquinone biosynthesis and significantly increase lifespan (<link linkend="bib6">Ewbank et al., 1997</link><!-- : PMID 9020081 -->; <link linkend="bib45">Wong et al., 1995</link><!-- : PMID 7768437 -->). Finally, exposure to antimycin A, a tight-binding inhibitor of
            complex III, reduces rates of respiration and promotes longevity (<link linkend="bib3">Dillin et al., 2002</link><!-- : PMID 12399591 -->). Given the presence of 12 key MRC genes on the
            mtDNA and the intimate connections between MRC function and lifespan, it seems
            inevitable that mutations that slow aging will be identified in one or more of those 12
            genes.</para>

        <title>Perspectives</title>
        <para>The mitochondrial genome is often ignored although it is a vital component of animal
            metabolism, physiology, and development. Few studies have specifically addressed the
                <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> mtDNA and much of our knowledge is inferred from
            investigations of vertebrate mtDNAs and from bioinformatic approaches. The <emphasis>C.
                elegans</emphasis> cellular machinery required for mtDNA maintenance and expression
            is almost completely unexplored; undoubtedly biological novelties remain to be exposed.
            Deciphering how mitochondria communicate with the remainder of the cell will have
            far-reaching implications for understanding cellular metabolism in normal and in
            diseased states. Few model systems offer as many advantages as the nematode for grasping
            the full importance and scope of mitochondrial genetics in animal life.</para>
