<title>Figure 3. DAF-16/FoxO regulators and cofactors.</title>
<para>DAF-16/FoxO is directly regulated by the serine/threonine kinases AAK-2, CST-1, and JNK-1, the arginine methyltransferase PRMT-1, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase RLE-1. The mechanistic basis for DAF-16/FoxO regulation by BAR-1, SIR-2.1, SMK-1, TORC1, the EAK proteins, and HCF-1 has not been established. See text for details.</para>
