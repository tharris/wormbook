<title>Figure 1. Schematic of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> IIS.</title>
<para>Active IIS promotes the phosphorylation-dependent cytoplasmic sequestration of the transcription factors DAF-16/FoxO, HSF-1, and SKN-1/Nrf. The insulin/IGF-1 receptor ortholog DAF-2 and other pathway components that promote IIS are colored red, and molecules that either antagonize IIS or are antagonized by IIS are colored green. Insulin-like peptides, which may either promote or antagonize DAF-2 activity, are colored black. See text for details. Abbreviations: ILPs, insulin-like peptides; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP<subscript>2</subscript>, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP<subscript>3</subscript>, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate.</para>
