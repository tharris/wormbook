<para>Model of vulva formation in <emphasis>O. tipulae</emphasis>. The vulva is formed by the progeny of P(5-7).p with a 2&#x00B0;-1&#x00B0;-2&#x00B0; pattern as in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P4.p;class=Cell" role="_blank">P4.p</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P8.p;class=Cell" role="_blank">P8.p</ulink> usually adopt a epidermal fate and their progeny fuse with the epidermal syncytium <emphasis>hyp7</emphasis>. P(4-8).p form a vulva equivalence group. The three vulval cell fates within the equivalence group are specified by two successive inductions by the AC on the Pn.p cells and their daughters (color code as in <link linkend="figure4">Fig. 4</link>). The subsequent division pattern of each cell is given at the bottom. The sublineages of Pn.p granddaughters are abbreviated as follows: s, fuses with the hypodermal syncytium; u, remained undivided; t, divides transversally (left-right). After fusion of cells with the same terminal fate, the progeny of P(5-7).p give rise to six vulval rings, lettered vulA to vulF. Reprinted from Louvet-Vallee (2003).
