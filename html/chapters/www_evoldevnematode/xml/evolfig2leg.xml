<para>A cartoon comparison of the <emphasis>P. pacificus</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> adult hermaphrodite gonads. Somatic tissues are shown in red, germline tissues in blue. Differences shown include: (1) The path of gonadal arm migration. (2) The morphology of the turn of the gonadal arms. (3) The cellular composition of the sheath and spermathecal corridor. (4) The cellular and sub-cellular morphology of the sheath (thin red lines represent actin filaments). (5) The absence of valve cells (VC) in <emphasis>P. pacificus</emphasis>. (6) The extent of diakinesis in the germ line. (7) A difference in size between sperm. Reprinted from <link linkend="bib37">Rudel et al., (2005)</link>, with permission.</para>
