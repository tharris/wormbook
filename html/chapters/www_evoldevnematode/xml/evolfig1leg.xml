<para>Didelphic and monodelphic nematode gonads. Cell linage and gonad development in: <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> hemaphrodites (A), <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> males (B), <emphasis>Panagrellus redivivus</emphasis> females (C), and <emphasis>Mesorhabditis</emphasis> sp. 1179 females (D). Lineages: Line length represents the relative timing of divisions. Terminal Xs at the lineage base represent cell deaths; terminal colors represent the predominant fate of the progeny of those cells: Dark red DTCs (distal tip cells): Purple, sheath/spermatheca in females and seminal vesicle in males; Red, uterus in females and vas deferens in males; Light pink, anchor cell in females and the linker cell in males; Dark pink, posterior pouch in <emphasis>P. redivivus</emphasis> females. Diagrams of gonad development: Diagrams of the initial somatic divisions and the somatic gonad primordium (SP) stage are shown for all animals; intermediate stages shown vary between animals. Small colored circles represent the relative position of nuclei. Colors in the lineages correlate to the colors of individual nuclei at the SP stage. Arrows represent migrations in the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> male gonad to break the symmetry of the gonad. <emphasis>Mesorhabditis</emphasis> starts with a 3-cell primordium as a single germline precursor is present. Arrowheads represent the position of the vulva and the cloaca. Reprinted from Rudel and Sommer (2003), with permission.</para>
