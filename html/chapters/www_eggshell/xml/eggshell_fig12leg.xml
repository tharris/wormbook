<title>Figure 12</title><para>The peri-embryonic space (layer) is quite fluid and amorphous. Left: A fluorescence image of <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE31868;class=Protein" role="_blank">CPG-2</ulink> was acquired immediately before cryoimmobilization and processing for transmission electron microscopy (n = 3). Middle: Alignment of the resulting correlative transmission electron micrograph (TEM) image allows visualization of the edge of the permeability barrier (red arrowheads). Right: A pseudocolored micrograph illustrates the location of the chitin and CPG eggshell layers along with the edge of the permeability barrier. The peri-embryonic layer and perivitelline space (extra-embryonic matrix) and the first polar body are also labeled. Bars, 10 &mu;m (left); 1 &mu;m (middle and right).
