<title>Figure 4</title><para>TEM of cortical granules. (A) A mature <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> oocyte contains cortical granules (arrows); inset shows higher magnification of vesicles near the oocyte chromosomes (asterisks). (B) An embryo within the spermatheca contains a cortical granule near the plasma membrane (upper right arrow), and a cluster of heterogeneous vesicles (lower arrows). (C) A metaphase I embryo contains cortical granules (arrows) distributed across the cortex (asterisk denotes chromosome in spindle). The cortical granules are found in close association with reticulate ER (A-C). (D) Embryos at metaphase II (chromosome in spindle indicated by lower left white asterisk) lack cortical granules, and the polar body (upper right white asterisk) is trapped between eggshell layers (arrows).
