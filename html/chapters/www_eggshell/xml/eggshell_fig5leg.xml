<title>Figure 5</title><para>A wave of cortical granule exocytosis during anaphase I. <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> embryos expressing histone::GFP and labeled with the plasma membrane dye FM2-10 were imaged using a Swept Field Confocal system every 200 milliseconds. After chromosome separation initiated (A), exocytic events (arrows) occurred near the spindle (B) and spread across the cortex (C, D) before the completion of anaphase I. Images in C and D are maximum projection summations of several frames in which a vesicle fusion event occurs. A gap is formed between the plasma membrane and the vitelline layer (now known as the permeability barrier) near the polar body (E, bracket). (F) Images of the plasma membrane before and after exocytosis, labeled with FM2-10 or a fluorescent dextran. Scale bar: 10 &mu;m.
