<title>Figure 1</title><para>Schematic of the layers of the <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> eggshell.  Shown is the trilaminar eggshell consisting of an outermost vitelline layer (VL; black), a middle chitin layer (CL; red), and an innermost chondroitin proteoglycan layer (CPG; blue). Separating the trilaminar outer eggshell from the inner permeability barrier (dark green) is the extra-embryonic matrix (EEM; white). Under the permeability barrier layer is an amorphous peri-embryonic layer (light green), which coats the embryo proper (gray). The plasma membrane of the embryo is shown as a black line. The peri-embryonic layer is most obvious at the anterior of the embryo. The polar bodies are shown in dark blue; the first polar body is immobilized in the CPG layer of the trilaminar outer eggshell, while the second polar body is mobile in the peri-embryonic layer. The position of the polar bodies is indicative of both the times at which the meiotic divisions are occurring and at which each eggshell layer is being synthesized.</para>
