<title>Figure 11</title><para>The two polar bodies in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> embryos are differently localized after their extrusion. (A) DIC image of a wild-type embryo with two visible polar bodies. The first polar body is localized at the apex of the anterior whereas the second polar body stays in contact with the plasma membrane. (B) and (C), EM of sections. (B) The first polar body is tightly associated with the chitin layer and is fully embedded in the LrL (which is now called the CPG layer). (C) The second polar body is separated from the embryo and is surrounded by a filamentous, embryonic layer (EmL, which is now referred to as the peri-embryonic layer) (D) The entire embryo is surrounded by the EmL or peri-embryonic layer.

The perimembrane space is called the extra-embryonic matrix throughout this chapter.</para>
