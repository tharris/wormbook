<title>Figure 8</title><para>The permeability barrier is a distinct envelope that forms between the trilaminar eggshell and the embryo. Embryos placed in Oregon green (OG) phalloidin (left; n = 14), fluorescein (middle; n = 7), or 3,000-D fluorescein dextran (right; n = 10) were imaged by differential interference contrast (DIC; top row) and fluorescence (middle row; green in merge) microscopy. Magnified views of the embryo anterior are shown on the right (yellow dashed lines mark the embryo plasma membrane; yellow arrows point to the edge of the permeability barrier). Bars, 10 &mu;m.
