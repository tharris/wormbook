Shown is the ultrastructure of wild-type and <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00004075;class=Gene" role="_blank">pod-1</ulink></emphasis> mutant eggshells. In each panel, an embryo with its eggshell is shown. (A) Three layers are visible in the wild-type <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> eggshells: a thin vitelline layer (black line indicated with lower arrowhead), a chitinous layer (light-staining layer indicated with central arrowhead), and a lipid-rich layer (darker layer indicated by upper arrowhead; now known as the CPG layer). (B) All three layers are present and appear normal at this resolution in the <emphasis role="italic">pod-1(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00275388;class=Variation" role="_blank">ye11</ulink>)</emphasis> eggshell (left pointing arrowheads). However, an extra layer of dark-staining material is evident on the outside of the <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00004075;class=Gene" role="_blank">pod-1</ulink></emphasis> mutant embryos (right pointing arrowhead) that is not evident in wild type.
