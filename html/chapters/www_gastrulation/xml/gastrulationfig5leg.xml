        <title>Figure 5. Gastrulation in intact embryos, devitellinized embryos, and P<subscript>1</subscript> isolates</title>
        <para>Asterisks indicate Ea and Ep, and arrowheads indicate MSxx and P<subscript>4</subscript>. 0 minutes indicates the start of gastrulation movements. (A-D) Time-lapse images of gastrulation in an intact embryo (same embryo as <xref linkend="figure1"/>C), (E-H) in a devitellinized embryo, and (I-P) in P<subscript>1</subscript> isolates. Variation of starting orientation between intact and devitellinized embryos  is due to devitellinization (A versus E). The two sets of P<subscript>1</subscript> isolate images represent  two different division patterns, either in a dumbbell orientation (I-L) or in a linear orientation (M-P). Linear orientation occurs in less than 10% of all P<subscript>1</subscript> isolates. Other division patterns were variations between these two extremes.
