        <title>Figure 6. Ea and Ep direct the movement of their neighbors</title>
        <para>On the left side of each panel is a schematic drawing of part of a P<subscript>1</subscript> isolate and an experiment that was performed. Cells in the isolates were separated at the site  indicated by the broken line, rotated along the axis indicated by the gray line in A, and then recombined. Black curved arrows indicate the direction of movement of the reference cell. On the right of each panel is a corresponding side view, in which the P<subscript>1</subscript> isolate is oriented as if viewed from one end, either P<subscript>4</subscript> or MSxx (as indicated). Yellow arrows indicate the direction of movement of P<subscript>4</subscript> cells and the green arrows indicate the direction of movement of MSxx cells. (A) Separation and recombination of Ea and Ep, with P<subscript>4</subscript> as the reference cell; (B) MSxx and Ea, with P<subscript>4</subscript> as the reference cell; or (C) P<subscript>4</subscript> and Ep, with MSxx as the reference cell.
