        <title>Figure 8. Ingression and apical myosin localization in <emphasis>par(ZF1)</emphasis> embryos</title>
        <para>(A, a-c) Ea/p (asterisks) position in the same embryo filmed at the 24-cell stage (a), 28-cell stage (b) and 46-cell stage (c). Ea and Ep are internalized and have divided by the 46-cell stage; two of their descendants are indicated with double asterisks. An MSxx cell (black triangle) can be observed moving over the apical surfaces of Ea/Ep. (A, d-f) Ea/p in a <emphasis>par-3(ZF1)</emphasis> embryo at the 24-cell stage (d), 28-cell stage (e) and 46-cell stage (f). Ingression is slow and the descendants of Ea/p (double asterisks) can be seen on the surface of the embryo at the 46-cell stage (A,f). (B) Myosin localization during Ea/p ingression. (a-c) Wild-type embryo expressing myosin-GFP filmed at 3 minute intervals beginning at the 26-cell stage. (d-f) <emphasis>par-3(ZF1)</emphasis> embryo expressing myosin-GFP filmed at 3 minute intervals beginning at the 26-cell stage. Myosin accumulates at the apical surfaces of Ea/p in wild-type (B,c; arrow) but not in <emphasis>par-3(ZF1)</emphasis> embryos (B,f; arrow).
