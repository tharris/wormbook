        <title>Figure 2. Apical-basal PAR asymmetry</title>
        <para>(A, C) Early four-cell stage embryo co-stained with PAR-3 (A) and PAR-2 (C). PAR-3 (red arrows) localizes to the entire cortex of somatic cells; PAR-2 (green arrow) is found at basolateral surfaces of somatic cells. (B, D) 7-8 cell embryos. PAR-3 (B) is enriched at apical surfaces of somatic cells and PAR-2 (D) is found at basolateral surfaces. The germ-line precursor, where PAR proteins exhibit anterior-posterior asymmetries, is indicated with an asterisk in all panels.
