        <title>Figure 1. Formation of the blastocoel</title>
        <para>Formation of the blastocoel. (A) 26-cell stage embryo. Apical ("a"), lateral ("l") and
            basal ("b") surfaces of a cell are indicated. The blastocoel (arrowheads) forms between
            basal surfaces of cells. (B) Descendants of an AB cell that has divided in culture. A
            blastocoel-like cavity (arrowhead) is present in the center of the cell cluster. (C-D) Transmission electron micrographs of cell contacts in a 28-cell stage embryo; both
            panels are shown at the same magnification (bar = 1 <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x03BC;</symbol> m). (C) Lateral surfaces of cells are adherent and only occasionally separated by small separations (arrowhead). (D) Large separations can form between the basal surfaces of cells. Cell-cell contacts between  lateral surfaces are indicated by opposing arrowheads. Modified and reprinted with permission from Nance and Priess (2002).</para>
