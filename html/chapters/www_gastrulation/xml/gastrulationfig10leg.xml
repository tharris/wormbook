        <title>Figure 10. Model for <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> gastrulation</title>
        <para>Cell contacts determine the apical/basal localization of PAR proteins. PAR proteins affect cell adhesion and direct an apical enrichment of myosin. A detectable enrichment may not be required for gastrulation, since gastrulation can occur, although with a delay, in the absence of detectable myosin enrichment. The apical surfaces of Ea and Ep  constrict, bringing neighboring cells underneath, between the E cells and the eggshell, and resulting in the ingression of Ea and Ep. Adhesion and MSxx rolling may also play roles in gastrulation movements. Solid arrows denote established relationships or mechanisms, whereas dashed lines denote hypothesized phenomena. Hatched lines on the E cells in the diagram represent the actomyosin network. Light gray line represents part of the eggshell.
