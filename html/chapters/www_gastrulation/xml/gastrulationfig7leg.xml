        <title>Figure 7. Apical constriction of Ea and Ep during gastrulation</title>
        <para>(A) Kymograph derived from movements of microspheres (white) during gastrulation from one film of a wild-type P<subscript>1</subscript> isolate. In the kymograph, the image in each frame of the  time-lapse recording is used to generate horizontal lines of image data that are pasted together in descending order; hence time is represented on the y-axis. First and last frame used for the kymograph are above and below the kymograph, respectively. Asterisks label Ea and Ep, Ea/Ep boundary is marked by yellow arrowhead in still frames and by the yellow line in the kymograph, and the white arrow notes the direction of MSxx movement. The microspheres on Ep can be seen converging toward each other during gastrulation movements. (B) Summary of microsphere movements from 10 films. Each arrow represents the total displacement and angle of movement by each microsphere. "X" indicates microspheres that did not exhibit any displacement relative to the cell's displacement. (C) Average of the vectors. Insets show the directions of microsphere movement from each quadrant, with the average direction in gray. The average velocity for each set of vectors  shown below the box. Reprinted with permission from Lee and Goldstein (2003).</para>
