        <title>Figure 9. Cell ingressions during gastrulation</title>
        <para>(A) Major embryonic cell lineages. Each lineage produces cells that ingress during  gastrulation. (B) Position of cell nuclei in a 26-cell stage embryo, lateral perspective, at the onset of gastrulation. Nuclei are colored according to lineage as in (A); AB descendants that do not produce ingressing cells are shown in gray. Note that most ancestors of ingressing cells are born on or near the ventral surface. (C) Map of  the ventral surface showing regions of ingression by lineage, colored as in (A); the map is drawn in two panels for clarity. Times of ingression within each region are indicated  in minutes after the two-cell stage. Modified and reprinted with permission from Nance and Priess (2002).</para>
