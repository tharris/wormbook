		<para>Phylogenetic analysis of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> hermaphrodite lineages using mtDNA and nuclear sequences. Bootstrap values (maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood) are indicated at each node. AB1 is the only strain whose placement differs in the two trees, suggesting that it is the product of recombination between two divergent genotypes. A. Bootstrap consensus tree for <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> natural isolates, using 70 nuclear variable sites from <link linkend="bib21">Denver et al. (2003<!--; PMID 12644560-->)</link> and <link linkend="bib43">Koch et al. (2000<!--; PMID 11076854-->)</link>. Note that in the latter set, most SNPs were found by sequencing CB4857. B. Unrooted phylogram of the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> natural isolates using 11,443 bp of mitochondrial DNA sequences. From <link linkend="bib21">Denver et al. (2003<!--; PMID 12644560-->)</link>.</para>
