		<title>Figure 2. Mutation accumulation lines.</title>
		<para>A. Mutation accumulation lines are obtained by transferring a single larva at each generation for many generations. Spontaneous mutations accumulate, with minimal selection. Many lines are kept in parallel, and can be frozen at intervals to keep a record of their evolution. Due to the accumulation of highly deleterious mutations, some lines are lost: from 100 original lines, only 58 were kept up to 396 generations (<link linkend="bib65">Vassilieva et al., 2000</link><!--; PMID 11005291-->). B. Frequency distribution between the different mutation accumulation lines of a fitness measure (the intrinsic rate of increase) after 214 generations (<link linkend="bib65">Vassilieva et al., 2000</link><!--; PMID 11005291-->). C. Frequency distribution of body size between the same lines at an average of 152 generations (<link linkend="bib3">Azevedo et al., 2002</link><!--; PMID 12399386-->).</para>
