		<para><emphasis><emphasis role="bold">C. elegans</emphasis></emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">presents a low level of molecular diversity, which may be explained by its selfing mode of reproduction. Recent work on the genetic structure of natural populations of</emphasis> <emphasis><emphasis role="bold">C. elegans</emphasis></emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">indeed suggests a low level of outcrossing, and little geographic differentiation because of migration. The level and pattern of molecular diversity among wild isolates of</emphasis> <emphasis><emphasis role="bold">C. elegans</emphasis></emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">are compared with those found after accumulation of spontaneous mutations in the laboratory. The last part of the chapter reviews phenotypic differences among wild isolates of</emphasis> <emphasis><emphasis role="bold">C. elegans.</emphasis></emphasis></para>
	</abstract>
		<para>Most studies on <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> use a single genetic background, that of the N2 strain. Its biological features as unravelled in the laboratory may be better interpreted with more knowledge of their evolutionary origin and ecological significance. Moreover, the diversity of wild isolates is a source of phenotypic variations that can be studied like mutant phenotypes.</para>
		<para>In addition, the mode of reproduction of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> makes it a great system to study the regulation, consequences and evolution of outcrossing versus selfing breeding systems. Obvious questions concern the frequency of outcrossing, the geographic structure of populations (are populations locally clonal?) and the fate of deleterious mutations. Although evolutionary and ecological studies of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> have been scarce until a few years ago, its short generation time, the ease of obtaining isogenic lines by selfing and the ability to retain frozen stocks make it a model system with a future in evolutionary biology.</para>
		<para>We will successively review what is currently known about I. its molecular diversity and the genetic structure of populations, and II. its phenotypic diversity.</para>

		<title>Molecular polymorphisms and population genetics</title>
		<para>Early work on molecular polymorphisms in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> was based on a set of natural isolates that were collected worldwide over many years, each kept as a single selfing isogenic strain (available at CGC). These isolates come from North America (mostly California), Western Europe (including N2, the reference strain, isolated in Bristol, U.K.) and Adelaide (Australia); one isolate, CB4856, was sampled in Hawaii and is used for SNP mapping (see <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_SNPsintrotwopointmap/SNPsintrotwopointmap.html">SNPs: introduction and 2-point mapping</ulink>; <link linkend="bib35">Hodgkin and Doniach, 1997</link><!--; PMID 9136008-->; <link linkend="figure1">Figure 1</link>). These isolates are used as representatives of the molecular and phenotypic variation within the species, even though they may miss a signifcant part of it, due to geographically restricted sampling. <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> could never be isolated in samples from Asia (unlike <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis>), but not much sampling was attempted in Africa nor South America.</para>

		<para>Recently, several sets of wild isolates were collected from Western Europe and California (plus one strain from Madeira; <link linkend="bib31">Haber et al., 2005</link><!--; PMID 15371529-->; <link linkend="bib6">Barri&#x000E8;re and F&#x000E9;lix, 2005</link><!--; PMID 16005289-->; <link linkend="bib57">Sivasundar and Hey, 2005</link><!-- PMID: 16139217-->).

			<title>Low molecular diversity of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis></title>
			<para>The level and pattern of genetic diversity depend on the rate and pattern of mutation, which can be measured after accumulation of spontaneous mutations in the laboratory. Mutation accumulation (MA) lines are established by picking a single individual at each generation, therefore limiting natural selection as much as possible (<link linkend="figure2">Figure 2</link>). They represent the raw mutational process, whereas the diversity observed among wild isolates is the result of mutation as well as population structure and phenotypic selection. We first review for mitochondrial and nuclear DNA the observed molecular diversity in wild isolates, then the mutation rate and pattern in MA lines, and compare them to reveal the action of selection in natural populations.</para>

				<para>The comparison of the mutation pattern in MA lines versus wild isolates suggests that the excess of transitions over transversions in wild isolates is due to a mutational bias. In contrast, indels and replacement mutations in coding regions are less frequent among wild isolates than in MA lines, suggesting that they are counterselected (<link linkend="table1">Table 1</link>; <link linkend="bib20">Denver et al., 2000</link><!--; PMID 11009418-->).</para>

				<title>Polymorphism in the nuclear genome revealed by shotgun sequencing or AFLP</title>
				<para>The nuclear polymorphism level was first measured by sequencing random regions of the genome of four wild isolates: AB1, CB4857, RC301 and TR403 (<link linkend="bib43">Koch et al., 2000</link><!--; PMID 11076854-->). Extensive shotgun data (12 Mb) were then obtained for CB4856, which harbours variant polymorphisms distributed over the whole genome (compared to N2), allowing its use for genetic mapping of mutations (see <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_SNPsintrotwopointmap/SNPsintrotwopointmap.html">SNPs: introduction and 2-point mapping</ulink>; <link linkend="bib62">Swan et al., 2002</link><!--; PMID 12097347-->; <link linkend="bib69">Wicks et al., 2001</link><!--; PMID 11381264-->).

				<para>Whole-genome diversity was also investigated using AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism), a whole-genome fingerprinting technique, on four populations from France (<link linkend="bib6">Barri&#x000E8;re and F&#x000E9;lix, 2005</link><!--; PMID 16005289-->). For sampling, individuals (12&#x02013;19/location) were picked as they crawled out of the substrate, avoiding as much as possible post-sampling selection and ensuring a true representation of natural population diversity.

				<para><link linkend="bib60">Stewart et al.

For 10 of these genes, functional alleles are present in some wild isolates. Half of these genes apparently became non-functional by a substitution creating a stop codon, and half through a deletion affecting the reading frame. Five of the putatively functional alleles were only found in CB4856 and JU258. The other polymorphisms observed in the same gene sequences also make CB4856 and JU258 the most divergent strains compared to N2, with 25 and 14 polymorphisms, respectively (compared to 4 polymorphisms in Bergerac/RW7000, the third most divergent strain). Overall, chemoreceptor genes appear to have a 5- to 10-fold higher level of polymorphism than the whole genome average, and different genes showed widely different polymorphism levels, from 15 polymorphisms in 9.4 kb to none in 17 kb.</para>

				<title>Microsatellite polymorphism</title>
				<para>Microsatellites are short repeated sequences (ranging from two to six nucleotides), which are highly prone to slippage during replication, and therefore highly mutable. Microsatellite mutation rates in MA lines range from 8.93 &#x000D7; 10<superscript>-5</superscript> to 1.85 &#x000D7; 10<superscript>-2</superscript> per locus per generation, depending of the size and nature of the repeats (<link linkend="bib28">Frisse, 1999</link><!--; PMID-->; <link linkend="bib56">Sivasundar and Hey, 2003</link><!--; PMID 12586703-->). Mononucleotide microsatellites, also called homopolymeric loci, are sequences of eight or more repeats of a single nucleotide; 30 length change mutations and one base substitution were identified in homopolymers in MA lines (<link linkend="bib18">Denver et al., 2004</link><!--; PMID 15170261-->), giving a mutation rate range from 4.5 &#x000D7; 10<superscript>-6</superscript> per generation for A/T homopolymers to 1.5 &#x000D7; 10<superscript>-4</superscript> per generation for long G/C homopolymers (<link linkend="table1">Table 1</link>). 2&#x00025; of homopolymers are found in protein-coding sequences, which results in an average of 0.03 homopolymer mutation in exon sequence per genome per generation.</para>

				<title>Effective population size</title>
				<para>An important parameter in population genetics is the effective population size (N<subscript>e</subscript>), which represents the number of individuals of an equivalent ideal random-mating population under mutation and genetic drift, or the number of individuals contributing to the next generation. It is calculated from the mutation rate &#x003BC; and the observed molecular diversity <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x003C0;</symbol> from <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x003C0;</symbol> = 4N<subscript>e</subscript>&#x003BC;.

				<title>Conclusion: Low genetic diversity of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis></title>
				<para>At least in the locations sampled so far, <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> presents a low genetic diversity, comparable to that of humans and 20-fold lower than that found in <emphasis>Drosophila melanogaster</emphasis>. Its molecular mutation rate is not particularly low. The level of genetic diversity depends on the structure of natural populations. For example, <emphasis>Homo sapiens</emphasis> has a low nucleotide diversity, due to a recent bottleneck in the population. The pattern of microsatellite diversity of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> does not show evidence for a recent global bottleneck followed by population expansion (<link linkend="bib56">Sivasundar and Hey, 2003</link><!--; PMID 12586703-->). The reproductive mode also influences genetic diversity, which is expected to be reduced in partial selfers such as <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> or <emphasis>Arabidopsis thaliana</emphasis>: selfing results in a two-fold reduction in effective population size, and genetic diversity is further reduced by the fact that selection at one locus results in the selection of the entire genome under genetic linkage (<link linkend="bib32">Hartl and Clark, 1997</link><!--; PMID-->). We will now review the geographic structuring and the reproductive mode of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>.</para>

				<title>Diversity at different spatial scales</title>
				<para>When the natural isolates are partitioned by world region, most of the genetic variation is found within a continent: for example, the microsatellite genetic diversities within North America and Europe are of 0.83 and 0.85, respectively, which is close to the 0.92 diversity over the whole dataset (<link linkend="bib31">Haber et al., 2005</link><!--; PMID 15371529-->).</para>
				<para>At a local scale, <link linkend="bib31">Haber et al. (2005<!--; PMID 15371529-->)</link> and <link linkend="bib57">Sivasundar and Hey (2005)</link> found microsatellite polymorphism within compost heaps in Germany, and soil samples in California, respectively. Effective population size estimates range from 750 to 12,000 in different local populations. In these two sets of samples, individuals were isolated after several (five to 24) days in the laboratory and may therefore have been the progeny (F1&#x02013;F5) of wild individuals and thus not faithfully represent diversity in the corresponding natural populations.</para>
				<para>Barri&#x000E8;re and F&#x000E9;lix picked independent wild-born individuals directly from the substrate. Using AFLP analysis, estimates for within-population nucleotide diversity range from 0.02 to 0.43 &#x000D7; 10<superscript>-3</superscript> per nucleotide for different populations (N<subscript>e</subscript> = 200&#x02013;5,100; <link linkend="table2">Table 2</link>). The within-sample diversity is spread over a large range, from almost null to a level of diversity comparable to the global diversity (and to the distance between N2 and CB4856). In cases where the intra-sample diversity was low, a diversity of 0.80 &#x000D7; 10<superscript>-3</superscript> was recovered when three samples were sampled 10&#x02013;30 meters away (<link linkend="bib6">Barri&#x000E8;re and F&#x000E9;lix, 2005</link><!--; PMID 16005289-->).</para>
				<para>Thus, local diversity seems to remain high until the scale of a few cm<superscript>3</superscript>. In some samples, it then breaks down, probably as a consequence of local bottlenecks followed by selfing of a single individual (see <link linkend="sec1_4">section 1.4</link>). The large variance in within-sample diversity may also reflect a lack of demographic stability in some populations, with transient bottlenecks that reduce genetic diversity. Together with known ecological features of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, this suggests that a metapopulation dynamics (many small populations, experiencing frequent extinctions and <emphasis>de novo</emphasis> colonizations) could apply to its natural populations.</para>

				<title>Geographic structure of populations</title>
				<para>Local diversity may be the result of local mutation or of input of alleles through migration, which can be distinguished by measuring the frequency of different alleles in different populations.</para>
				<para>Allelic frequencies correlate only weakly with geographic origin among the sampled world regions (Western Europe, North America, Australia, Hawaii, Madeira; <link linkend="bib56">Sivasundar and Hey, 2003</link><!--; PMID 12586703-->; <link linkend="bib31">Haber et al., 2005</link><!--; PMID 15371529-->). Indeed, isolates from the same region can be significantly divergent, whereas very similar genotypes are found on different continents (<link linkend="bib35">Hodgkin and Doniach, 1997</link><!--; PMID 9136008-->; <link linkend="bib43">Koch et al., 2000</link><!--; PMID 11076854-->). At a smaller scale in the four populations sampled in France, for more than half of polymorphisms within each population, both alleles are also found outside this population (<link linkend="bib6">Barri&#x000E8;re and F&#x000E9;lix, 2005</link><!--; PMID 16005289-->), suggesting that local diversity is fostered by either a large population size at population foundation, or later migration. Moreover, no correlation was found between geographical and genetic distances (<link linkend="bib56">Sivasundar and Hey, 2003</link><!--; PMID 12586703-->; <link linkend="bib6">Barri&#x000E8;re and F&#x000E9;lix, 2005</link><!--; PMID 16005289-->), thus further suggesting that the migration rate is large enough that isolation by distance does not contribute substantially.</para>
				<para>These results suggest that <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> is a better migrant than previously thought. The dauer larva is likely to be a dispersal stage, through its association with other animals (see <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_phylogrhabditids/phylorhab.html">The phylogenetic relationships of <emphasis>Caenorhabditis</emphasis> and other rhabditids</ulink>). Because <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> is easily found within gardens and compost heaps, human activity may also be a major factor in its present migration patterns and distribution.</para>
				<para>Two wild isolates however stand out in terms of level of divergence and specific alleles, namely CB4856 and JU258. 70&#x00025; of the SNPs identified in CB4856/Hawaii were not found in nine other strains, indicating that this strain has significantly diverged (<link linkend="bib43">Koch et al., 2000</link><!--; PMID 11076854-->). JU258/Madeira was not included in the earlier analyses, but now appears to share specific polymorphisms with CB4856 (<link linkend="bib60">Stewart et al., 2004</link><!--; PMID 15520260-->; <link linkend="bib31">Haber et al., 2005</link><!--; PMID 15371529-->).

In laboratory conditions, hermaphrodites are limited by their sperm production to about 300 self-progeny, whereas males may have a much larger number of progeny. In outcrossing events, male sperm is more efficient in mating than hermaphrodite sperm, and in <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> (AF16 strain), X-bearing male sperm is more efficient than non-X-bearing male sperm (<link linkend="bib44">LaMunyon and Ward, 1995</link><!--; PMID 7649241-->; <link linkend="bib45">LaMunyon and Ward, 1997</link><!--; PMID 8990183-->).</para>

				<para>When N2 males are placed in culture with hermaphrodites at an initial 50&#x00025; frequency, their proportion is rapidly reduced to the non-disjunction equilibrium, due to a low mating ability and the apparent absence of an advantage for outcrossed over selfed progeny (<link linkend="bib33">Hodgkin, 1983</link><!--; PMID-->; <link linkend="bib10">Chasnov and Chow, 2002</link><!--; PMID 11901116-->; <link linkend="bib59">Stewart and Phillips, 2002</link><!--; PMID 11901115-->; <link linkend="bib12">Cutter and Payseur, 2003</link><!--; PMID 12872911-->).</para>

				<title>Outcrossing in natural populations</title>
				<para>Outcrossing in the wild can be detected by several methods:</para>
				<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
				<listitem><para>Recombination of alleles at different loci</para>
				<para>The most sensitive method for detecting outcrossing is based on reassortments of alleles at different loci in the genome. If <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> only reproduced by selfing, different loci would follow the same tree lineage as mitochondrial DNA, and the whole genome would behave as a single genetic linkage block. Indeed, a partial but significant correlation between phylogenies built from either nuclear or mitochondrial sequence data (<link linkend="figure3">Figure 3</link>) suggests that outcrossing occurs, but is rare in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib21">Denver et al., 2003</link><!--; PMID 12644560-->).</para>
				<para>Outcrossing can be inferred when all four combinations of two alleles at two loci are found (4-gamete test; <link linkend="bib37">Hudson and Kaplan, 1985</link><!--; PMID 4029609-->), or by mapping the occurrence of an allele onto an independently established tree, provided there is no homoplasy (that is, no convergent mutations). Many such putative recombination events were found using sequence (<link linkend="bib43">Koch et al., 2000</link><!--; PMID 11076854-->; <link linkend="bib21">Denver et al., 2003</link><!--; PMID 12644560-->; <link linkend="bib31">Haber et al., 2005</link><!--; PMID 15371529-->) or AFLP data (<link linkend="bib6">Barri&#x000E8;re and F&#x000E9;lix, 2005</link><!--; PMID 16005289-->). Yet large chromosomal regions appear to remain linked, suggesting little outcrossing (<link linkend="bib24">Egilmez et al., 1995</link><!--; PMID 7769614-->; <link linkend="bib43">Koch et al., 2000</link><!--; PMID 11076854-->; <link linkend="bib21">Denver et al., 2003</link><!--; PMID 12644560-->).</para>
				<para>Linkage disequilibrium is a quantitative measure of association between polymorphic loci in a population; since the recombination frequency increases with outcrossing, linkage disequilibrium decreases. In <emphasis>Drosophila melanogaster</emphasis> populations, linkage disequilibrium only extends for 100 bp-1 kb. Within local <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> populations, linkage disequilibrium was found to be high for randomly chosen loci in the samples from Northwest Germany (<link linkend="bib31">Haber et al., 2005</link><!--; PMID 15371529-->) and France (<link linkend="bib6">Barri&#x000E8;re and F&#x000E9;lix, 2005</link><!--; PMID 16005289-->). The outcrossing rate can be estimated from linkage disequilibrium and effective population size. In two populations sampled in France, it was estimated to one outcrossing every 7,400 (95&#x00025; confidence interval: 6,000&#x02013;19,000) and 17,400 (95&#x00025; c. i.: 1/3,200-complete selfing) generations, suggesting exceptional outcrossing.</para>
				<para>At the global scale however, no linkage disequilibrium could be detected using random microsatellite markers (<link linkend="bib56">Sivasundar and Hey, 2003</link><!--; PMID 12586703-->). It may be that microsatellites mutate too fast to detect the chromosomal linkage blocks suggested by <link linkend="bib24">Egilmez et al. (1995<!--; PMID 7769614-->)</link>, <link linkend="bib43">Koch et al. (2000<!--; PMID 11076854-->)</link>, <link linkend="bib21">Denver et al.

				<listitem><para>Presence of heterozygotes</para>
				<para>Given the frequency of two alleles at a given locus in a population, the outcrossing frequency can be calculated from the observed frequency of heterozygotes (assuming non-assortative mating of different genotypes).</para>
				<para>(<link linkend="bib57">Sivasundar and Hey, 2005</link>) isolated <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> individuals using a RNA interference-based assay (performed several days after soil sample collection) and measured heterozygote frequency using microsatellite polymorphisms. From allele frequencies and the frequency of heterozygotes, they estimated the outcrossing rate in the wild ancestors at the time of sampling. For different populations sampled in Southern California, estimates range from complete selfing to one outcrossing every 5 generations, with a rate of one outcrossing every 7 generations over the whole dataset (i.e. an outcrossing rate of 14&#x00025;).</para>
				<para>Among individuals directly sampled from four natural populations from France, heterozygotes could also be detected using microsatellites, and the overall outcrossing rate estimated to 1&#x00025; (<link linkend="bib6">Barri&#x000E8;re and F&#x000E9;lix, 2005</link><!--; PMID 16005289-->). The difference between both studies may possibly result from variations between natural populations, either in the ecological context (for example seasonal or geographical variations in outcrossing rates) or in genetic variation in spontaneous-male-occurrence or fertility.</para>
				<para>These heterozygote-based estimates do not seem compatible with the much lower estimates inferred from linkage disequilibrium data, and with the partial congruence of mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies. However, the latter methods measure outcrossing over a longer time period, taking into account population structure, changes in selfing rate over time and possible mating preferences.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Presence of males</para>
				<para>Outcrossing results in a high frequency of males in the next generation, since half of the cross-progeny is male. A survey of individual worms sampled directly from the wild (13 samples on 3 sampling sites over 6 months) found only two males out of 1,135 individuals (<link linkend="bib6">Barri&#x000E8;re and F&#x000E9;lix, 2005</link><!--; PMID 16005289-->). This very low occurrence of males is fully compatible with the rate of spontaneous male production in the laboratory. These populations thus reproduce mostly by selfing, but occasional bursts of sexual reproduction would remain undetected by this criterion.</para></listitem>

				<title>Conclusion: A world traveler with rare sexual encounters</title>
				<para>Overall, these results suggest that <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> overwhelmingly reproduces by selfing in the wild and that outcrossing is only occasional. Most likely, males produced by spontaneous X-chromosome non-disjunction only rarely mate. Since male mating results in more males, sexual reproduction in small populations is likely to occur by unstable bursts of variable duration. Recombination of genotypes is rendered possible by the coexistence of diverse genotypes in the same location. Outcrossing is sufficiently infrequent relative to the mutation rate that the genomes remain incompletely mixed over large chromosomal segments.</para>
				<para>On an evolutionary timescale, the level of outcrossing has consequences. Since males of most <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> wild isolates retain the ability to mate (<link linkend="bib35">Hodgkin and Doniach, 1997</link><!--; PMID 9136008-->), even if not very efficiently, the maintenance of genes required for male-specific development and behavior seems to imply the existence of outcrossing in the wild. On the other hand, <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> hermaphrodites produce much less male-attracting pheromone than females of other <emphasis>Caenorhabditis</emphasis> species, consistent with the fact that outcrossing is not required (<link linkend="bib10">Chasnov and Chow, 2002</link><!--; PMID 11901116-->; <link linkend="bib46">Lipton et al., 2004</link><!--; PMID 15329389-->).</para>
				<para>Other theoretical consequences of a high degree of selfing are the rapid elimination of highly deleterious recessive mutations (because they are not masked in the heterozygous state when they appear) and on the other hand the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations (&#x0201C;M&#x000FC;ller&apos;s ratchet&#x0201D;). In addition to outcrossing, the rapid evolution of compensatory mutations (see below) could help to eliminate the phenotypic effect of deleterious mutations. The evolutionary feedback of phenotypes on genotypes becomes highly relevant at this point.</para>

				<para>Any operational definition of fitness is only partial and may not include the most relevant parameters in the wild, which vary with ecological contexts. In the laboratory, a &#x0201C;fitness&#x0201D; parameter can be computed from measures of progeny number and generation time. This laboratory &#x0201C;fitness&#x0201D; decreases at a rate of about 0.1&#x00025; per generation in mutation accumulation lines, which is slower than in <emphasis>Drosophila</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib41">Keightley and Caballero, 1997</link><!--; PMID 9108062-->; <link linkend="bib67">Vassilieva and Lynch, 1999</link><!--; PMID 9872953-->; <link linkend="bib66">Vassilieva et al., 2000</link><!--; PMID 11005291-->; <link linkend="figure2">Figure 2</link>). Knowing the fitness decrease the molecular mutation rate and the proportion of constrained nucleotides as estimated from a genome comparison with <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis>, it appears that most deleterious mutations that are eliminated in the wild cannot be detected in the laboratory, either because they have a very mild deleterious effect that would nevertheless be relevant in large populations or because they have a stronger effect in another environment (<link linkend="bib14">Davies et al., 1999</link><!--; PMID 10481013-->; <link linkend="bib18">Denver et al., 2004</link><!--; PMID 15170261-->; <link linkend="bib27">Estes et al., 2004</link><!--; PMID 15082546-->).</para>

This rapid recovery over 10-80 generations most likely occurs through compensatory extragenic mutations (<link linkend="bib26">Estes and Lynch, 2003</link><!--; PMID-->). A population undergoing successive bottlenecks and expansions is thus able to recover despite the fixation of deleterious alleles by random drift during the bottlenecks.</para>

			<title>Genetic analysis of a natural phenotypic variation</title>
			<para>Phenotypic variation between two wild isolates may be due to variation at a single major locus, in which case it can be studied genetically like a laboratory mutant phenotype. It is then relatively easy to determine the nature of the gene and the type of alteration (<emphasis>cis</emphasis>-regulatory or protein change, loss or gain-of-function), as was done for the <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=npr-1" role="_blank">npr-1</ulink></emphasis> locus.</para>
			<para>The phenotypic variation may however be due to genetic variation at more than one major locus. This can be deduced either from a phenotypic analysis of the F2s of a cross, or using Recombinant Inbred Lines (RIL; <link linkend="figure6">Figure 6</link>). Each RI line has a random combination of the two parental genomes in the homozygous state - a great simplification compared to F2 analysis because it removes all heterozygous combinations and allows the study of frequency traits on an isogenic population. If the variation is monogenic, each parental phenotype will be found in half of the RI lines. Otherwise, the proportions may be altered, or intermediate or extreme phenotypes be found. With several loci, the different alleles may interact additively or epistatically. For example, the variation in <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P3.p;class=Cell" role="_blank">P3.p</ulink> division frequency between the N2 and CB4857 or that between the <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> strains AF16 and HK104 in male ray position are the consequences of genetic variation at several loci (<link linkend="bib8">Bonnaud et al., 2002</link><!--; PMID-->; <link linkend="bib5">Baird et al., 2005</link><!--; PMID 15634358-->; <link linkend="figure6">Figure 6</link>).</para>

			<para>Even if two wild isolates display a similar phenotype, the phenotype of some RI lines may lie outside the range of the phenotypic distribution of both parents. This so-called transgressive segregation indicates that alleles from both parents at different loci act in the same direction on the trait when combined (<link linkend="bib65">van Swinderen et al., 1997</link><!--; PMID 9223344-->; <link linkend="bib17">Delattre and F&#x000E9;lix, 2001</link><!--; PMID 11369226-->) and thus indicates evolution in the molecular mechanisms that underlie the phenotype. For example, if the two parental isolates have similar phenotypes, some of the lines may show a distinct phenotype, thus revealing cryptic genetic variation.</para>
			<para>The genetic structure of populations (see above) and the genetic architecture of a polymorphic trait bear on how a polymorphism appears, spreads and is maintained in wild populations. A polymorphism found in extant populations may be a transient quasi-neutral polymorphism (which may be maintained for a long time because of population isolation), a recent and currently spreading variant, or a polymorphism that is maintained because of selective advantages of both forms in specific ecological conditions.</para>
