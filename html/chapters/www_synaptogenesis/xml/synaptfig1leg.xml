		<title>Figure 1. Electron microscope images of worm synapses</title>
		<para>(A) Ventral nerve cord fixed by classical method using osmium and glutaraldehyde. (B) Ventral nerve cord fixed by high-pressure freezing. Images in A and B are taken from (<link linkend="bib40">Rostaing et al., 2004</link><!--; PMID 14688212-->) with permission. M, muscle; N, presynaptic terminal; Mit, mitochondria. Yellow arrows, SV; orange triangles, MT; *, space between nerve processes. Scale: 500nm. (C&#x02013;E) Images of synapses by classical fixation method: neuron-neuron synapse in the ventral nerve cord (C), cholinergic neuromuscular junction (D), and GABAergic NMJ (E). M, muscle; N, presynaptic terminal; Mit, mitochondria. (F&#x02013;G). Images of synapse by high-pressure fixation procedure. G shows an enlarged view of the presynaptic density (R. Weimer and J-L. Bessereau, personal communication). Yellow arrows, SV; light-blue arrows, dense core vesicles; dark-blue arrow, large core vesicle; green arrows, postsynaptic density-like structures; pink-purple arrow, presynaptic density; orange triangle, MT. (H). Image of longitudinal section of ventral nerve cord, showing the sharp transition of SV cluster and MT nearby. Black arrows, presynaptic density; orange triangles, MT; A, axon; M, muscle. Taken from <link linkend="bib18">Hedgecock and Hall (1991)</link><!--; PMID--> with permission.</para>
