<para>Intraflagellar transport in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. Components of the IFT machinery and ciliary cargo assemble at or near the transition zone (basal body). Two kinesins, heterotrimeric kinesin-II and homodimeric OSM-3-kinesin, separately bind IFT particle subcomplexes A and B, respectively, and transport these together with IFT-dynein and cargo along the middle segment in the anterograde (+) direction. In the distal segment, OSM-3-kinesin alone transports the IFT particles and dynein/cargo. BBS proteins act to stabilize the association between the motors and IFT particle subcomplexes A and B. Components of the IFT machinery and presumably other ciliary molecules are recycled back to the base of the cilium using the IFT-dynein molecular motor. The lengths of the transition zone (1 &#x003BC;m), middle segment (4 &#x003BC;m) and distal segment (2.5 &#x003BC;m) regions are shown (for amphid cilia) along with transverse view schematics of the microtubule arrangements (on top).</para>
