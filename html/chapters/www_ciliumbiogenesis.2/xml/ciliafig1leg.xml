		<title>Figure 1. Ultrastructures of cilia and relative positions of all known ciliated neurons (cell bodies and associated dendrites) in the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> hermaphrodite.</title>
		<para>The top two panels show electron micrograph cross-sections of amphid cilia in the middle segment (microtubule doublets; left panel) and distal segment (microtubule singlets; right panel; adapted from <link linkend="bib29">Evans et al., 2006</link><!--; PMID 16492809-->). The worm figures illustrate the positions of the all ciliated cell bodies and their dendritic extensions. The four insets show, schematically, electron micrograph reconstructions of known ciliated endings (adapted from <link linkend="bib69">Perkins et al. (1986)</link><!--; PMID 2428682--> for amphids and phasmids and <link linkend="bib94">Ward et al. (1975)</link> for labial and cephalic neurons). Cu, cuticle; CR, ciliary rootlet; SCu, subcuticle; So, socket cell; Sh, sheath cell.</para>
