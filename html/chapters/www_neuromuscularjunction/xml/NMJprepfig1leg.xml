<title>Figure 1. Schematic of the worm dissection.</title>
<para>1. Worms thrashing in extracellular saline within the recording chamber are initially glued to the Sylgard coated cover slip by applying glue to either the head or tail. The glue is then along the cuticle until the entire length of the worm is glued as shown in 2. The inset shows that the glue forms a stabilizing ridge adjacent to the cuticle. The cuticle incision is made by piercing the cuticle with a sharp glass needle close to the interface with the glue at about mid-body length. The dashed line indicates the progression of the cut towards the head. 3. After sucking out the gonad arm, eggs and intestine from the region exposed by the cut, a clean cuticle flap should be observed. The flap is glued using small spots of glue, exposing the body wall muscles (in red) and ventral nerve cord (green). The inset shows an example of a cut open preparation (GABA neurons labeled with GFP, muscles with Texas red-labeled phaloidin).</para>
