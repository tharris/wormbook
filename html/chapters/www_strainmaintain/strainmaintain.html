            <p>This chapter discusses the maintenance of <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> in the laboratory. Topics include the acquisition of worm strains from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Caenorhabditis</em></span> Genetics Center (CGC), methods of culture and transfer, decontamination of stocks, synchronizing and staging cultures, and
               procedures for freezing worms for long-term storage and for recovering them from the frozen state.

               <p>The CGC was established at the University of Missouri, Columbia, in 1979. In 1992 the CGC moved from Missouri to the University
                  of Minnesota, St. Paul. Funded through a contract with the National Institutes of Health National Center for Research Resources
                  (NIH NCRR), the basic mission of the CGC is to provide <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> strains and information to scientists initiating or continuing research using <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span>. The CGC strives to acquire and have available for distribution stocks representing at least one mutant allele of each published
                  gene and all chromosome rearrangements (deficiencies, duplications, translocations, inversions). In addition, many wild-type
                  isolates of <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> and several species closely related to <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> are available. The CGC maintains an up-to-date bibliographic list of all articles, reviews and books that discuss <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span>. The Worm Breeder's Gazette (WBG), a newsletter that is published three times per year, is available in hard copy from the
                  CGC for a small two-year subscription fee, and it is available free of charge on the internet. The WBG contains a <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> bibliographic update, announcements and news, a directory of <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> researchers, and abstracts submitted by <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> researchers who briefly describe their current work.
               </p>
               <p>The jobs of maintaining the <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> genetic nomenclature and the genetic map are handled by the CGC as a subcontract under the directorship of Jonathan Hodgkin
                  at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England. A second subcontract helps Leon Avery (Southwestern Medical
                  Center, University of Texas, Dallas) maintain the <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> World Wide Web WWW Server (<a href="http://elegans.swmed.edu/" target="_blank">http://www.eatworms.swmed</a>) as a source of information about <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span>, including the services of the CGC and descriptions of strains that are available.

               <p>Wild-type and over 3,000 mutant strains of <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> are available at no cost to researchers at educational institutions or non-profit organizations. To obtain strains, submit
                  a written request (letter, fax, or email) describing the strains, genes, or alleles desired and a brief statement of the intended
                  use of the worms. Include within the request the name, complete mailing address and phone numbers of the person requesting
                  the strain(s).
               </p>
               <p>Researchers at commercial or for-profit organizations are required to pay a fee of $100.00 plus postage for each strain of
                  worms or bacteria ordered. A "Commercial Sector Order Form" is available from the CGC; a completed form must be received by
                  the CGC before strains will be sent to commercial organizations.
               </p>
               <p>All requests for strains or information should be sent to: <span class="emphasis"><em>Caenorhabditis</em></span> Genetics Center, University of Minnesota, 250 Biological Sciences Center, 1445 Gortner Avenue, St. Paul, MN  55108-1095 USA.
                  Requests can also be faxed [(612) 625-5754] or emailed [<a href="mailto:cgc@umn.edu" target="_top">cgc@umn.edu</a>].

               <p>Upon receipt of a strain request, the CGC will send a response confirming that the order has been received. The requested
                  strains are either thawed from a freezer vial or recovered from a starved plate kept in an incubator at 11<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C. Animals of each strain are placed on freshly prepared Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) petri plates that have been spread with
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> as a source of food and allowed to reproduce for several days. The visible phenotype of the stock is noted to confirm that
                  it matches the published description. The petri plates are then wrapped with Parafilm and mailed to the requester. It takes
                  7-10 days for a strain request to be received, processed and filled. If a requested strain has a temperature sensitive lethal
                  phenotype, the stock is allowed to starve at permissive temperature before the plates are shipped, a step that takes an additional
                  3-4 days. This results in the formation of heat-resistant dauer larvae (see <a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_introandbasics/introandbasics.html" target="_blank">Genetic mapping and manipulation-Introduction and basics</a>).
               </p>
               <p>Strains are sent on NGM petri plates with the worms still feeding on <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 (or starved, as mentioned above). The plates are shipped in bubble-lined mailing bags via First Class or Air Mail. Postage
                  costs are paid by the CGC except for commercial orders. Strains can be shipped via Federal Express if the requester provides
                  the CGC with a Federal Express account number to bill the courier costs. Strains sent outside the USA have a United States
                  Postal Service Customs (CN22) sticker applied to the package. The sticker declares that the package contains "non-pathogenic,
                  non-parasitic biological specimens of no commercial value." Occasionally the customs departments of other countries require
                  that additional information be applied to the package. In such cases, the requester should supply the CGC with the needed
                  information.
               </p>
               <p>Strains are sent with a Strain Information Sheet, which gives the genotype, phenotype, culturing conditions and derivation
                  of the stock, as well as a bibliographic reference. Requesters are asked to inform the CGC of the date the strains were received
                  and their condition on arrival. The CGC should be acknowledged in any publication that results from the use of strains acquired
                  from the CGC.

               <p>Although <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> can be maintained axenically (<a href="#bib1">Avery, 1993</a>), it is difficult, and the animals grow very slowly. <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> is usually grown monoxenically in the laboratory using <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> strain OP50 as a food source (<a href="#bib2">Brenner, 1974</a>). <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 is a uracil auxotroph whose growth is limited on NGM plates. A limited bacterial lawn is desirable because it allows
                  for easier observation and better mating of the worms. A starter culture of <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 can be obtained from the CGC or can be recovered from worm plates. Use the starter culture to isolate single colonies
                  on a streak plate of a rich medium such as LB agar [10 g Bacto-tryptone, 5 g Bacto-yeast, 5 g NaCL, 15 g agar, H<sub>2</sub> O to 1 litre, pH 7.5] (<a href="#bib3">Byerly et al., 1976</a>). Using a single colony from the streak plate, aseptically inoculate a rich broth, such as L Broth [10 g Bacto-tryptone,
                  5 g Bacto-yeast, 5 g NaCl, H<sub>2</sub> O to 1 litre, pH to 7.0 using 1 M NaOH. Put 100 ml into 250 ml screw-cap bottles and autoclave. The bottles of media can
                  be stored at room temperature for several months (<a href="#bib3">Byerly et al., 1976</a>)]. Allow inoculated cultures to grow overnight at 37<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C. The <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 solution is then ready for use in seeding NGM plates. The <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 streak plate and liquid culture should be stored at 4<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C and will remain usable for several months.

                  				<span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> is maintained in the laboratory on Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) agar which has been aseptically poured into petri plates
                  (<a href="#bib2">Brenner, 1974</a>). Several sizes of petri plates are available and can be purchased from companies such as Nunc or Falcon. Smaller plates
                  (35 mm diameter) are useful for matings or when using expensive drugs. Medium size plates (60 mm diameter) are useful for
                  general strain maintenance, and larger plates (100 mm diameter) are useful for growing larger quantities of worms, such as
                  for certain mutant screens. The NGM agar medium can be poured into petri plates easily and aseptically using a peristaltic
                  pump. The CGC uses a Wheaton Unispense liquid dispenser (Wheaton Science Products). This pump can be adjusted so that a constant
                  amount of NGM agar is dispensed into each petri plate. A constant amount of agar in the plates reduces the need for refocusing
                  the microscope when you switch from one plate to another. When desired, drugs (e.g., levamisole, streptomycin or nystatin)
                  can be added to the NGM solution just prior to its being poured <a href="#bib4">Caldicott et al., 1994</a>).

               <p>It may be desirable to use 96- or 24-well microtiter plates when using expensive drugs or screening a large number of individual
                  animals. For 24-well plates, use 1.5 ml NGM agar and seed with an <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 lawn (<a href="#bib5">Hartman and Herman, 1982</a>). 96-well plates can be filled with 50 <span class="symbol">&#956;</span>l of a 1% (w/w) suspension of <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 in S Medium (see Protocol 2) (<a href="#bib6">Hirsh et al., 1976</a>). 96-well plates can also be filled with 50 <span class="symbol">&#956;</span>l of NGM liquid with <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> HB101 each well. To do this, packed <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> HB101 cells are suspended in 4X their volume of NGM liquid, assuming 1g of cells equals 1 ml. One volume of the <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> suspension is then added to 24 volumes of NGM liquid (Ralph Clover, personal communication). <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> HB101 is available from the CGC. Care should be taken to prevent worms from crawling between wells; only one strain of <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> should be used per microtiter plate so that there is no possibility of strains mixing.

               <p>Using sterile technique, apply approximately 0.05 ml of <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 liquid culture to small or medium NGM plates or 0.1 ml to large NGM plates using a pipet. If desired, the drop can be
                  spread using the pipet tip or a glass rod. Spreading will create a larger lawn, which can aid in visualizing the worms. Take
                  care not to spread the lawn all the way to the edges of the plate; keep the lawn in the center. The worms tend to spend most
                  of the time in the bacteria. If the lawn extends to the edges of the plate the worms may crawl up the sides of the plate,
                  dry out and die.

                  				<span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> is transparent and can be visualized using a dissecting stereomicroscope equipped with a transmitted light source. The CGC
                  uses Wild Leitz model M5A or Zeiss model SV6. Standard 10X eyepieces and objectives which range from 0.6X to 5X (total magnification
                  of 6X to 50X) are widely used.
               </p>
               <p>Several methods are used for transferring <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> from one petri plate to another. A quick and convenient method is "chunking", wherein a sterilized scalpel or spatula is
                  used to move a chunk of agar from an old plate to a fresh plate. There will usually be hundreds of worms in the chunk of agar.
                  The worms will crawl out of the chunk and spread out onto the bacterial lawn of the new plate. This method works well for
                  transferring worms that have burrowed into the agar or are difficult to pick individually (such as on a starved plate). The
                  chunking method is fine for transferring homozygous stocks but it is not advisable if the population is heterozygous or if
                  a stock must be maintained by mating.
               </p>
               <p>Another method that will transfer many worms is to use strips of sterilized filter paper which have been cut to &frac12; to &frac14; inch
                  wide and 2-3 inches long. The sterilized filter paper is gently set upon the petri plate, where it absorbs moisture and picks
                  up worms. The filter paper is then touched to a fresh NGM plate where the worms are deposited. Discard the filter paper after
                  use. This method is also fine for transferring homozygous stocks but it is not advisable if the population is heterozygous
                  or must be maintained by mating.
               </p>
               <p>A third method is to pick single animals with a worm picker. A worm picker can be made by mounting a 1-inch piece of 32 gauge
                  platinum wire into either the tip of a Pasture pipet or in a bacteriological loop holder. Platinum wire heats and cools quickly
                  and can be flamed often (between transfers) to avoid contaminating the worm stocks. The end of the wire, used for picking
                  up worms, can be flattened slightly with a hammer and then filed with an emery cloth to remove sharp edges; sharp points can
                  poke holes in the worms and kill them or make holes in the agar. The tip of the wire can be fashioned to your liking. Some
                  people prefer a flattened end, while others prefer a slight bend that forms a hook. It takes a bit of experience with a worm
                  picker to avoid poking holes in the agar. Worms crawl into the holes, making it difficult to see or pick them.
               </p>
               <p>To pick a worm identified under the dissecting microscope, slowly lower the tip of the wire and gently swipe the tip at the
                  side of the worm and lift up. Another method is to get a blob of <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 on the end of the picker before gently touching it to the top of the chosen worm. The worm will stick to the bacteria.
                  Several animals at a time can be picked by this method, although worms left too long on the pick will desiccate and die. To
                  put a picked worm on a fresh plate, slowly lower the tip of the worm picker, gently touch the surface of the agar, and hold
                  it there to allow the worm to crawl off of the picker.

               <p>The frequency that you need to transfer your worms depends on their genotype, the temperature at which you grow them, and
                  what you plan to do with them. Heterozygotes and mating stocks should be transferred every 1-3 generations; it is easier to
                  transfer them if you do it before the plates have become starved. If you want to transfer individual animals from a starved
                  plate you may find it easier to first chunk the plate and then to pick individual animals after they have crawled out of the
                  chunk and into the bacterial lawn. If the animals are in the dauer stage (see <a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_introandbasics/introandbasics.html" target="_blank">Genetic mapping and manipulation-Introduction and basics</a>) you may need to wait a day before picking; the worms will develop out of the dauer stage, and the phenotypes can be scored.
                  When transferring heterozygous stocks that are not well balanced it is best to transfer just one worm to each new plate. This
                  allows you to score the progeny of the transferred worm and confirm that you did indeed transfer a heterozygote. To maintain
                  mating stocks (stocks with both males and hermaphrodites) transfer 6-8 adult males and 3-4 young adult hermaphrodites per
                  plate. You may allow homozygous stocks to starve for several weeks between transfers. Stocks grown at 25<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C will starve several days sooner than identical stocks grown at 16<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C. It is possible to keep stock plates at 11<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C or 16<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C for several months between transfers. To prevent a plate from drying out, wrap it with a strip of Parafilm. Alternatively,
                  you may want to transfer your stocks every 1-2 days so that you have a source of animals at every stage of development.

                  				<span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> stocks can best be maintained between 16<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C and 25<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C, most typically at 20<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C. <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> grows 2.1 times faster at 25<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C than at 16<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C, and 1.3 times faster at 20<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C than at 16<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C (<a href="#bib8">Maniatis et al., 1982</a>). This variation in growth periods can be useful when planning experiments.
               </p>
               <p>Take note of specific growth requirements (e.g., temperature sensitivity or dauer defective) and maintain your stocks accordingly.
                  Such information is included on the Strain Information Sheet that is sent with each strain shipped from the CGC.
               </p>
               <p>Stock plates do not need to be stored in a covered container. They will eventually dry out, but this won't be a problem if
                  you transfer animals before the plates reach that condition. If you do store your plates in a covered container be sure to
                  watch for signs of high humidity. Although rare, it is possible for worms to crawl (or be carried in a drop of water) from
                  one plate to another in such conditions, resulting in the mixing of strains.
               </p>
               <p>When pouring or seeding plates, or when transferring worms, it is best to keep the amount of time the cover is removed at
                  a minimum. This cuts down on contamination. If you have mold on a plate, carefully wrap the plate with a strip of Parafilm
                  and dispose of it. Do not take the cover off of a contaminated plate or you risk contaminating other plates. If you must transfer
                  from a contaminated plate, see the section below on Cleaning contaminated stocks.
               </p>
               <p>Label the bottom of the petri plate with the strain name and date. Don't label only the cover, as it may accidentally be separated
                  from the bottom. Discarded plates should be placed in a plastic bag and autoclaved.

            <p>Large quantities of <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> can be grown in liquid medium. Liquid cultures of <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> are usually grown on S Medium using concentrated <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 as a food source (<a href="#bib7">Lewis and Fleming, 1995</a>). It is often best to grow just one generation of worms in liquid before the worms are harvested. When growing worms for
               more than one generation, overcrowding can often lead to dauer formation despite the presence of food.
            </p>
            <p>Overnight cultures of <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 grown in LB or other rich broth medium should be used to make a concentrated pellet of bacteria. The concentrated pellet
               can be stored at 4<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C for several weeks or in a -70<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C freezer indefinitely. It is a good idea to have a large amount of concentrated <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 available so that food can be added as needed. The amount of food needed will depend on the starting inoculum of worms
               and the length of time the worms are grown. As a point of reference, you can grow a 250 ml batch of liquid culture by inoculating
               with worms recovered from 4 large (100 mm) petri plates and growing for 4-5 days. Initially, packed <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 from a 2 litre culture is provided. The worm culture is monitored, and additional <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 is added as needed.

               provided and the length of time the culture is grown. Freshly cleared cultures will yield worms equal to half the weight of
               the bacteria used (<a href="#bib7">Lewis and Fleming, 1995</a>).

            <p>Occasionally, <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> stocks may become contaminated with other bacteria, yeast or mold. It is easy to rid your worm stocks of contaminants. Most
               contaminants will not hurt the worms. (In fact, the worms like to climb some fungal hyphae and sway back and forth!) But it
               is much easier to score phenotypes and do transfers when your stocks are clean. Mold can be removed by chunking (Protocol
               3) and serially transferring, allowing the worms to crawl away from the contaminant. Bacterial contaminants and yeast are
               easily removed by treating with a hypochlorite solution, which will kill the contaminant and all worms not protected by the
               egg shell. This can be done using an entire plate that is contaminated (Protocol 4), or it can be done quickly using a single
               hermaphrodite (Protocol 5).

            <p>If only a small number of synchronized animals are needed, the eggs can be added to a thin layer of M9 Buffer in a 60 mm petri
               plate and allowed to grow overnight. The starved L1 animals can then be placed on seeded NGM petri plates, and synchronous
               growth will begin with the reintroduction of food. Animals should be monitored using the microscope and harvested at the desired
               stages.
            </p>
            <p>A population of dauer animals can be obtained by adding dauer-inducing pheromone to the liquid culture (<a href="#bib11">Vanfleteren, 1980</a>). Dauers can also be obtained by allowing a liquid culture to grow for several days after the culture is cleared of bacteria.
               The dauers can be separated from other stages by treating with 1% SDS for 30 min in a rotating tube and then washing once
               with H<sub>2</sub>O and once with M9 Buffer.

               			<span class="emphasis"><em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em></span> can be frozen and stored indefinitely in liquid nitrogen (<span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>196 <span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C) (<a href="#bib2">Brenner, 1974</a>). The keys to a successful freeze are using animals at the correct stage of development, the addition of glycerol to the
               freezing media, and a gradual cooling to -80<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C. Freshly starved young larvae (L1-L2 stage) survive freezing best. Well-fed animals, adults, eggs and dauers do not survive
               well. It is best to use several plates of worms that have just exhausted the <span class="emphasis"><em>E. coli</em></span> OP50 lawn and that contain lots of L1-L2 animals. A 15% final volume of glycerol in the freezing solution is used. A 1<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C decrease in temperature per minute is desirable during freezing. This can be achieved by placing the worms (in freezer vials)
               in a styrofoam container at -80<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C. The styrofoam container can be either a commercial shipping box (with walls at least &frac34; inch thick) or a small styrofoam
               box with slots for holding vials. After 12 or more hours at -80<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C, the freezer vials should be transferred to their permanent freezer location for long term storage.
            </p>
            <p>The CGC uses two solutions for freezing <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span>: a Liquid Freezing Solution (<a href="#bib2">Brenner, 1974</a>) and Soft Agar Freezing Solution (Leon Avery, personal communication). For long term storage of stocks in liquid nitrogen,
               Liquid Freezing Solution is recommended. When this solution is used, the worms settle to the bottom of the freezer vial, and
               no viable animals can be easily retrieved without thawing the entire contents of the vial. A Soft Agar Freezing Solution is
               useful for freezing working stocks of <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span>. The addition of the agar helps keep the worms suspended throughout the solution. A small scoop of the frozen contents can
               be taken, and the remainder can be left in the vial and returned to the freezer for later use. Vials frozen using Soft Agar
               Freezing Solution should be stored at -80<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C. If kept in liquid nitrogen, the contents become too hard, and the vial will need to be warmed before it is possible to
               remove a scoop of the contents. The warming period reduces the number of times live worms can be recovered from the vial.
               When stored at -80<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C there is no need to allow the vial to be warmed; the contents are soft enough to be used right away. We recover worms 3-4
               times from each vial of soft agar stock.
            </p>
            <p>Worms can be frozen in 1.8 ml cryotubes. The CGC uses Nunc Cryotube Vials (#65234) with internal threads and freezes six vials
               of each strain it receives. Two vials are frozen using Soft Agar Freezing Solution and are stored at <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>80<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C for use as working stocks. Four vials are frozen using Liquid Freezing Solution; one is thawed as a tester, and the other
               three are put in at least two different liquid nitrogen tanks. To fill strain requests, the working stocks that are kept at
               <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>80<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C are used. When the last vial of a stock stored at <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>80<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C is emptied, the worms are once again frozen using Soft Agar Freezing Solution in order to replace these vials. In theory,
               the stocks kept in liquid nitrogen will never need to be used since the soft agar stocks are continually replaced as they
               are depleted.
            </p>
            <p>The recovery of <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> from stocks stored in liquid nitrogen is in the range of 35-45% of the total number of animals frozen. This number decreases
               only slightly after many years of storage in liquid nitrogen. The recovery of stocks stored at <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>80<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C for many years (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>10) is not as high as liquid nitrogen, but worms can be safely stored this way for many years (CGC, unpublished data). Of
               course, a power failure can result in the loss of all stocks kept at <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>80<span class="symbol">&deg;</span>C, so it is very wise to keep at least one copy of all stocks in liquid nitrogen. Some mutants strains (especially certain
               Dpy mutants) do not survive freezing as well as wild-type animals.
