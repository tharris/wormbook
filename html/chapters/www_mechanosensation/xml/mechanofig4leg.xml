        <para>MRNs are indicated by ovals, interneurons by rounded rectangles, and motor neurons by
            rectangles. Arrows indicate chemical synapses; squares indicate gap junctions.
            Dopaminergic MRNs are lavender and cells expressing predicted dopamine receptors have
            lavender borders.</para>
