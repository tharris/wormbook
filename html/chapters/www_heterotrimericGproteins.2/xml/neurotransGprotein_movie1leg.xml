<para>A-C, still images of adult mid-body regions of wild type, <emphasis role="italic">goa-1(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00089973;class=Variation" role="_blank">n1134</ulink>)</emphasis> G&alpha;<subscript>o</subscript> partial loss-of-function mutant, and <emphasis role="italic">egl-30(<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00089674;class=Variation" role="_blank">n686</ulink>)</emphasis> G&alpha;<subscript>q</subscript> partial loss-of-function mutant animals, respectively. Unlaid eggs are visible as oval objects inside the body. While wild-type animals average &sim;12-16 unlaid eggs, G&alpha;<subscript>o</subscript> mutants lay almost all their eggs and thus accumulate only 2-3 unlaid eggs, while G&alpha;<subscript>q</subscript> mutants fail to lay eggs and accumulate &lt;40 unlaid eggs. D-F, videos of locomotion by larvae of the same genotypes. The locomotion defects seen are most obvious in larvae but adults show qualitatively similar defects. G&alpha;<subscript>o</subscript> mutants show hyperactive locomotion, with more frequent and deeper body bends, and more frequent reversals. G&alpha;<subscript>q</subscript> mutants show sluggish locomotion, with infrequent, shallow body bends. Magnification is the same in all images, so the scale bar in B applies to all panels.</para>
