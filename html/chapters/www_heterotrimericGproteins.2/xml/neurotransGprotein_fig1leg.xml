<para>In the inactive state (1), the G protein is an &alpha;&beta;&gamma; heterotrimer bound to GDP. When neurotransmitter binds the receptor (2), it assumes an active conformation that can bind the G protein heterotrimer and induce a conformational change in G&alpha; that releases GDP. GTP can then bind the open nucleotide site (3), inducing another conformational change in G&alpha; that releases both the receptor and G&beta;&gamma;. The separate G&alpha;-GTP and G&beta;&gamma; complexes can then associate with their respective effector proteins (4), which are typically transmembrane protein complexes, activating those effectors for downstream signaling. G&alpha; signaling is terminated when a Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS) protein induces G&alpha; to hydrolyze GTP (5), and G&beta;&gamma; signaling is terminated when G&beta;&gamma; re-associates with G&alpha;-GDP (1). The <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE33952;class=Protein" role="_blank">RIC-8</ulink> non-receptor nucleotide-exchange protein, working with GPR domain proteins, can prolong signaling by converting G&alpha;-GDP (5) back to G&alpha;-GTP (4). <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE33952;class=Protein" role="_blank">RIC-8</ulink> is also a chaperone required for G&alpha; folding and stability, which may be its principal function.</para>
