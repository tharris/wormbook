<para>G&alpha;<subscript>s</subscript> is induced to bind GTP to generate its active form by GPCRs. <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE33952;class=Protein" role="_blank">RIC-8</ulink> promotes signaling, either via its G&alpha; chaperone function or as a non-receptor activator. G&alpha;<subscript>s</subscript>-GTP inactivates itself (not shown) via its <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000646;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">slow</ulink> intrinsic GTPase activity. G&alpha;<subscript>s</subscript>-GTP activates the transmembrane enzyme adenylyl cyclase to generate the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP), which ultimately is hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterase. cAMP binds the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA), causing them to release the active subunit. PKA phosphorylation of unknown target proteins activates release of both synaptic and dense-core vesicles to increase neurotransmitter release. Solid grey arrows indicate direct physical interactions. Dashed arrow indicates a poorly understood effect. Green, proteins that promote G&alpha;<subscript>s</subscript> signaling; red, proteins that inhibit G&alpha;<subscript>s</subscript> signaling.</para>
