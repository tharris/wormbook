<para>A schematic summary of the effects of signaling by the three G&alpha; proteins on neurotransmitter release, as predicted from genetic studies in <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis>. In such diagrams, an arrow indicates promotion or activation of a target, while a bar denotes an inhibitory effect. The bars extending from G&alpha;<subscript>o</subscript> indicate that genetic experiments show G&alpha;<subscript>o</subscript> signaling inhibits G&alpha;<subscript>q</subscript> signaling, but do not determine whether this inhibition occurs upstream of G&alpha;<subscript>q</subscript>, at the level of G&alpha;<subscript>q</subscript>, or at some level downstream of G&alpha;<subscript>o</subscript>.</para>
