		<title>Figure 2. Cell lineage of the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> embryonic intestine.</title>
		<para>On the left is shown the conventional schematic lineage relating cell divisions and developmental time at 20&#x000B0;C. Anterior is to the left; posterior to the right; solid lines represent lineages on the left side of the animal; dotted lines represent lineages on the right side of the lineage. (Redrawn from <link linkend="bib70">Fukushige et al., 2005</link>). Right side of the figure represents the disposition of the various E cells in three dimensions. Small dumb-bells connect sister cells. Red circles (with red arrows) at the bottom right of the figure represent E lineage nuclei that migrate towards the embryonic midline in the process of epithelial polarization. The right side of the Figure is redrawn from part of <link linkend="figure1">Figure 1A</link> of <link linkend="bib136">Leung et al (1999)</link>; bilateral cell pairs in the intestine primordium are relabelled &#x0201C;a, b,..h&#x0201D; in order to retain the original nomenclature of the &#x0201C;ints&#x0201D; in the mature intestine, i.e. &#x0201C;int1, int2,..int9&#x0201D; (<link linkend="bib219">Sulston et al., 1983</link>).</para>
