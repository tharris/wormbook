		<title>Figure 3. Structure of the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> enterocyte.</title>
		<para>The transmission electron micrograph in the lower part of the figure is of a cross-section of a newly-hatched L1 larva (courtesy of Dr. J. Kormish and Mr. Wei Dong, University of Calgary). A single enterocyte, i.e., half of an &#x0201C;int&#x0201D;, is outlined in yellow. A schematic view of this enterocyte is shown at the top of the figure. Gene products (or other markers) that show differential localization to the apical or the basolateral domain are indicated, as described in more detail in the text.</para>
