            <p>Extracellular, intracellular, whole-cell and single-channel patch clamp recordings may all be made from the pharyngeal muscle.
               The type of recording made will be dictated by the information that is being sought. Extracellular recordings, termed electropharyngeograms
               or EPGs were pioneered by Leon Avery and co-workers (<a href="#bib1">Avery et al., 1995</a>) and provide information on parameters such as rate of pharyngeal pumping, duration of each pump (i.e. time between contraction
               and relaxation phases) and, by analysis of the shape of the EPG, the activity of neurones within the pharyngeal nervous system
               including the inhibitory neurone <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=M3;class=Cell" target="_blank">M3</a> and the pacemaker neurone MC (for details and examples see <a href="#bib5">Raizen and Avery, 1994</a>; <a href="#bib6">Raizen et al., 1995</a>). EPGs have the advantage of being relatively easy to record and yield information both on the activity of the muscle and
               the pharyngeal neurones. However, they give little reliable information on the magnitude of the pharyngeal potentials as the
               amplitude of the EPGs is very dependent on the positioning of the recording electrode and the properties of the seal with
               the worm's cuticle. In contrast, intracellular recordings are technically more challenging but are necessary if information
               on the resting membrane potential or shape of the pharyngeal action potential is required (e.g., <a href="#bib3">Lee et al., 1997</a>). Detailed analysis of the currents underlying the pharyngeal action potential may be obtained from whole-cell recording
               techniques. Although the pharyngeal muscle is not very amenable to voltage-clamp because of extensive electrical coupling
               between cells, nonetheless, it is possible to make a limited analysis of voltage-activated currents (<a href="#bib8">Shtonda and Avery, 2005</a>). Future progress on detailed analysis of the ionic currents in pharyngeal muscle may come from voltage-clamp studies on
               pharyngeal myoblasts in primary culture. Further information on the properties of single channels may also be obtained from
               patches excised from the pharynx, in either outside-out or inside-out configuration. The basic protocols for each of the electrophysiological
               techniques available for <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> pharynx are outlined below. For further background to the black art of microelectrode recording techniques consult <a href="#bib4">Purves (1981)</a>.

                        <p>A relatively stable recording table is required. An air-table is the best option but a stone slab, isolated from the frame
                           and supported on rubber bungs, is usually quite sufficient provided that the environment is not mechanically very noisy.
                        </p>

                     <li>
                        <p>An inverted microscope is better than an upright microscope as it provides more room to manoeuvre the electrode. The lamp
                           should have an external DC power supply to limit problems with electrical noise. An X/Y moveable stage helps with positioning
                           the preparation. Top of the range optics are not necessary, and x4 and x10 objectives will suffice.
                        </p>

                     <li>
                        <p>A micromanipulator is needed to hold the suction electrode. As these are extracellular recordings, very fine movement is not
                           required and a fairly coarse manual manipulator with fine movement in just the Z axis will suffice. Various options are available
                           for mounting the manipulator on the recording stage, depending on the microscope being used, but the important consideration
                           is stability. One option is to place the entire recording set-up on a metal surface (if using an air table this is the usual
                           surface) and to use a manipulator with a magnetic base.
                        </p>

                     <li>
                        <p>Electrical noise is one of the most severe limitations of the EPG technique as the amplitude of the EPG signal is relatively
                           small. The apparatus should be enclosed in a Faraday cage to limit noise and to allow for earthing.
                        </p>

                     <li>
                        <p>The recording chamber can be custom made from Perspex, or various options are available commercially. An easy and disposable
                           alternative is to pour Sylgard at a depth of 0.5 cm in a 9 cm Petri dish. Allow it to set and then cut the required shape
                           for the recording chamber out of the set Sylgard, allowing for a volume of approximately 1ml. Use a glass slide as the base
                           and attach the Sylgard chamber to it. If the preparation is to be used for pharmacological experiments then important considerations
                           are the volume of the bath versus the speed of the perfusion system to allow for rapid drug application and washing. To provide
                           a stable reference potential, it is advisable to use an Agar bridge. This consists of a fine-bore glass tube filled with 4%
                           Agar in 3 M KCl. The tube is bent so that one end can be placed in the recording chamber and the other in a small vial containing
                           3 M KCl to which the headstage ground is connected <span class="emphasis"><em>via</em></span> a silver-chloride coated silver electrode.

                        <p>A high-input impedance amplifier is required to record the EPGs, an analog to digital converter and a computer with software
                           for data acquisition and to allow for off-line analysis.

                        <p>A micropipette puller is required to pull the pipettes but a top of the range model is not necessary. A Narashige vertical
                           drop puller for patch pipettes will suffice. The choice of pipette glass is probably not critical. Thick-walled borosilicate
                           glass, 1 mm outer diameter without a filament is suitable. A pipette holder with a side-arm is used to hold the electrode.

               <p>Pick animals into Dent's saline (composition in mM; D-glucose 10 mM, HEPES 10, NaCl 140, KCl 6, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 3, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, pH 7.4 with NaOH). It is important to consider the physiological status of the animals if comparisons are to be made between
                  different groups. Therefore the age and nutritional status should be controlled for. Place the animals in a polystyrene tissue
                  culture dish. The animals stick a little to the bottom of the dish which slows locomotion and makes it easier to cut the heads.
                  An alternative method is to briefly chill the worms to immobilize them. Cut them (with a razor blade fragment held in a blade-holder)
                  at the level of pharyngeal-intestinal valve. A solution of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Dent's saline should be used
                  to release dissected tissue from the bottom of the Petri dish and ensure that it does not stick in pipettes. Transfer cut
                  heads to the recording chamber in approx 5&#956;l of 0.1% BSA Dent's using a Gilson pipette. To prepare the electrode for recording,
                  pull a low resistance micropipette large enough to fit the head of the animal but small enough to provide a snug fit, i.e.
                  about 10 &#956;m diameter. A good pipette will last for half a dozen recordings or more if care is taken not to break it. Back-fill
                  the micropipette with Dent's saline with a micropipette filler and attach it to the pipette holder. This has a silver-chloride
                  coated silver wire to act as an electrode. The pipette holder should also have a side arm to which a length of tubing and
                  a large (50 ml or more) syringe with a three-way tap is attached to enable suction to be applied. It is important that this
                  is sealed well so that the suction cannot leak. Earth the apparatus to the signal ground input on the recording amplifier.
                  Switch on the recording amplifier and set the tip potential to 0 mV using the voltage offset. Check the noise level. The EPGs
                  are relatively small in amplitude and therefore the technique cannot tolerate a noise level of much more than 0.2 mV. Bring
                  the electrode near to the anterior tip of the head and apply suction to the electrode thus attaching the head to the electrode.
                  Close off the three-way tap to maintain suction. This helps to keep the head on the electrode. The noise will increase as
                  the resistance of the seal increases. It may therefore be necessary to trouble-shoot additional sources of electrical noise
                  (turning off the microscope lamp may help). If a perfusion system is being used then it can be started at this point. The
                  amplitude and shape of the EPG are very dependent on the resistance of the seal and the relative placement of the electrode
                  and therefore it is difficult to make comparisons between individual animals unless one is careful to control for these factors.
                  Recordings may be made in voltage recording (&#8216;Bridge&#8217;) mode. Recordings in either voltage-clamp or current-clamp do not add
                  any advantage and simply introduce more electrical noise. This may necessitate filtering which can markedly distort the shape
                  of the signal. Drugs may be applied <span class="emphasis"><em>via</em></span> the perfusate or by aspiration of the bathing solution in the recording chamber.
               </p>
               <p>EPG recordings are very stable and may be maintained for up to one hour or more, enabling detailed analysis of the response
                  of the pharynx to different pharmacological agents. More care is required when making comparisons between mutant animals due
                  to the intrinsic variability of the EPG shape. One aspect of EPG recordings that remains relatively limiting is that the analysis
                  is still most accurately done manually, by cursor measurements on the digitized records. An example of an EPG is shown in
                  <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>. There is scope for new development here in the form of software for reliable automated analysis of EPG shape.

                  First, a very stable surface is required and it is advisable to use an anti-vibration table. Two manipulators are required,
                  one coarse and one fine. These should be mounted on opposite sides of the microscope. The microscope will also require better
                  optics than for EPG recordings e.g., a x40 objective. A recording amplifier such as the Axoclamp 2B (Axon Instrument, USA)
                  or similar is required. The properties of the intracellular electrode are the key to making successful recordings from the
                  pharynx. It must be robust enough to penetrate the tough basement membrane without damaging the small muscle cells. This requires
                  a short shank with a very sharp tip. It is also advisable to use hard glass e.g., quartz or aluminosilicate (1mm outer diameter,
                  with filament). Ideally, the electrodes should be pulled on a high specification horizontal puller (e.g., Sutter P2000 laser
                  puller) capable of reproducibly pulling hard glass. The electrodes should be pulled to a resistance of 80 to 100 M<span class="symbol">&#937;</span> resistance, filled with 4M KAcetate; 10mM KCl.

               <p>Prepare cut heads and transfer them to the recording chamber as described for <a href="#sec1_2" title="2.&nbsp;Protocol 1. Extrapharyngeal recordings (EPGs)">Protocol 1</a>. Next pull a suction pipette, similar to, but with a slightly smaller tip opening than that used for the EPG recordings.
                  The tip opening should fit over approximately one third of the terminal bulb. Place the suction electrode in an electrode
                  holder (with a side-arm attached to a syringe <span class="emphasis"><em>via</em></span> plastic tubing) and mount onto the coarse micromanipulator. Place the tip into the recording chamber and allow to back-fill
                  with saline. Place the intracellular electrode in the pipette holder mounted in the fine manipulator on the opposite side
                  of the microscope. This pipette will be used to hold the preparation in place and impart some structural rigidity to facilitate
                  impalement of the terminal bulb muscle cell by the sharp electrode. Bring the tip of the suction pipette near to the terminal
                  bulb of the pharynx and apply suction <span class="emphasis"><em>via</em></span> the syringe so that the terminal bulb is held gently by the pipette against the bottom of the recording chamber. Then advance
                  the intracellular recording electrode towards the opposite side of the terminal bulb until the tip dimples the muscle cell
                  membrane without actually puncturing it. Intracellular access to the cell may be achieved by over-utilization of the capacitance
                  compensation for the amplifier which causes the tip to cut through the membrane. (This ability is present on most amplifiers
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>via</em></span> a &#8216;buzz&#8217; or &#8216;zap&#8217; control). The resting membrane potential for wild type (N2) worms using standard Dent's saline outside
                  is approximately <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>70 to <span class="symbol">&#8722;</span>80mV. Every pharyngeal muscle pump coincides with an action potential that overshoots 0 mV by approximately 25 mV (<a href="#bib2">Franks et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>).

                     <p><b>Figure 2. An automated system for the correlation of electrical potentials and muscle movement in the <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> pharynx.&nbsp;</b>Intracellular recordings from the terminal bulb were made in the manner described. The muscle was simultaneously imaged using
                        a black and white CCD. The CCD supplied a standard PAL, interlaced video signal from which the vertical sync was extracted
                        using a simple circuit developed in-house. The extraction circuit was placed in-line between the video camera and a PC-based
                        frame grabber. It consisted of an LM1881 chip, used to read vertical sync data and pass it to a monostable oscillator (a 555
                        chip) set to generate one TTL pulse (Tag) for every two fields in the video feed. In an interlaced video signal, two fields
                        corresponds to one full frame of video. Therefore, every frame in the video sequence had an associated tag which was then
                        passed to the Digidata acquisition system to be recorded simultaneously with the electrophysiological events. A single command
                        switch simultaneously controlled the video feed to the frame grabber and also the output of the tag signal to ensure that
                        the first and last recorded video frames corresponded to the first and final tags in the sequence sent to the data acquisition
                        system. Each video frame was automatically analysed using a simple image/signal correlation algorithm. The degree of muscle
                        movement between video frames was calculated and matched back to the timing tags in the electrophysiological recordings. Briefly,
                        a region of interest ROI was defined manually and then signal intensity for each pixel in the ROI was automatically calculated.
                        The mean square difference (MSD) of ROIs in adjacent frames was calculated and used as a measure of muscle movement. As the
                        timing tags were based on the vertical sync signal of the PAL video feed MSD calculations were 40 ms apart. The figure shows
                        output from the full recording setup. A. Each frame of the video (iii) signal can be directly associated with a TTL timing
                        tag (ii) recorded simultaneously with the electrophysiological recording of membrane potential (i). The lumen of the terminal
                        bulb can be seen to gradually open and close in each successive frame during the action potential. One action potential corresponds
                        to one motor cycle in the terminal bulb. B. In this recording each full action potential (i) is reflected in the MSD trace
                        (ii). The mean latency of peak muscle contraction to peak action potential amplitude in this experiment was approximately
                        150 ms primarily reflecting the latency associated with excitation-contraction coupling in the pharyngeal muscle. Only six
                        action potentials are shown in the trace, which spans 4.5 seconds. However, the number of action potentials that can be recorded
                        with corresponding video and then processed, is limited only by the hard disk capacity and processing power of the PC used.

               <p>A protocol for recording whole cell currents from the corpus region of the pharyngeal muscle has been described by Avery (<a href="#bib8">Shtonda and Avery, 2005</a>). Recordings may also be made from the terminal bulb region (<a href="#bib9">Vinogradova et al., 2006</a>). The methods are similar to patch clamp techniques described for other cells with the additional challenge, and limitation,
                  that the geometry of the pharyngeal muscle makes it less amenable to this approach and voltage control will not be accurate.
                  Accordingly, care must be taken not to over interpret data from such studies. For recordings from the terminal bulb, heads
                  are transferred to the recording chamber, which contains a suitable external saline e.g., Dent's saline. A suction pipette
                  (filled with Dent's saline) is attached to the cut edge of the cuticle and used to gently hold the preparation against the
                  base of the recording chamber. The pharynx of <span class="emphasis"><em>C. elegans</em></span> is surrounded by a basement membrane which will interfere with seal formation and obtaining whole cell access. Therefore,
                  before one can begin to record from the muscle cells one needs remove the basement membrane by enzymatic digestion. A method
                  modified from (<a href="#bib7">Richmond and Jorgensen, 1999</a>) is suitable. First, treat the preparation with a solution of 0.1% trypsin in Dent's saline for 30 seconds and then wash
                  gently with Dent's saline to remove trypsin. Next, treat for 2&#8211;4 minutes with a solution containing (in Dent's): 0.23 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> Protease Type XIV and 0.62 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> Collagenase P. (The exact timing of this second treatment is crucial for success and will have to be determined by the operator).
                  Finally, wash gently with Dent's to stop digestion. Patch electrodes for whole-cell recordings may be pulled from Haematokrit
                  capillaries (resistance 3&#8211;5 M<span class="symbol">&#937;</span>) and filled with appropriate internal solutions (e.g., composition, in mM: 150 N-methyl-D-glucamine, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, 0.25 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 36 sucrose, 5 EGTA; pH 7.2). Single-channel recordings may be performed in outside-out and inside-out configuration using
                  thick-walled electrodes (GC150-7.5 glass, Harvard Apparatus). The electrode tips need to be coated with beeswax (to reduce
                  electrode capacitance) and fire-polished. Using these methods seal resistances in the range of 10&#8211;30 G<span class="symbol">&#937;</span> can be achieved. Data may be acquired with a patch-clamp amplifier in the standard manner. However, a special consideration
                  for whole cell recordings from pharynx is that the input capacitance is very large and cannot be reliably and accurately compensated.
                  Doubtless this is because of the highly folded surface of the muscle cell membrane and extensive electrical coupling between
                  cells. An example of a whole cell recording is shown in <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>.
