<para>The <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P5.p;class=Cell" role="_blank">P5.p</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P6.p;class=Cell" role="_blank">P6.p</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P7.p;class=Cell" role="_blank">P7.p</ulink> VPCs divide three times to produce 22 progeny. The vulval progeny differentiate to give rise to 7 different cell types (vulA to vulF). The homologous cells from <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P5.p;class=Cell" role="_blank">P5.p</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P7.p;class=Cell" role="_blank">P7.p</ulink> lineages fuse selectively to form 7 concentric toroids that are interconnected via AJM-1-containing apical junctions. During the mid-to-late-L3 stage the AC initiates invasion into the vulval epithelium. At the early-L4 stage it can be seen establishing the lumen in vulF thereby promoting a connection between vulva and uterine lumens. By the mid-L4 stage AC has fused with &#x03C0; progeny to form the utse cell and its nucleus has migrated (either anteriorly or posteriorly) away from the connection between the two lumens.</para>
