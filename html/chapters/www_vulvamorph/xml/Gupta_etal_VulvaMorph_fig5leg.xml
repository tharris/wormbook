<title>Figure 5. Uterine &#x03C0; cell developmental progression.</title>
<para>(A) The six ventral uterine cells (blue) surrounding the AC (green) adopt a &#x03C0; fate in response to signaling (arrows) from the anchor cell. (B) The &#x03C0; cells divide once with a dorsal-ventral orientation (double headed arrow), producing twelve &#x03C0; cells. The AC invades the vulF precursors, forming a lumen in vulF (purple). (C) The ventral, outer &#x03C0; progeny change shape and adopt the uv1 fate (dark blue). The uv1 cells remain in close proximity to vulF. The remaining eight &#x03C0; progeny fuse with each other and the retreating AC to form the uterine seam (utse) cell, which expands in the anterior posterior plane (double headed arrow) to form the mature utse cell. (D) The mature utse cell has a thin cytoplasm that overlies the vulva and the uv1 cells and arms that extend laterally to the anterior and the posterior along the lateral wall of the animal. The arms curve ventrally to flank the vulva. The nine nuclei of the utse cell are found at the ends of the arms (not shown). (E and E&#x2032;) The uv1 cells have adopted a sterotypical morphology with a concave dorsal surface (E&#x2032;) by the time of vulval eversion (E). The uv1 cells are visualized with a P<emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=ida-1;class=Gene" role="_blank">ida-1</ulink></emphasis>::GFP transgene, <emphasis>inIs179</emphasis>. (F and F&#x2032;) Both the uv1 cells (arrows) and uste cell (outlined) are visibile in this ventral view of a young adult animal with a mature vulva. Cells are visualized with a Pexc-9::GFP transgene.</para>
