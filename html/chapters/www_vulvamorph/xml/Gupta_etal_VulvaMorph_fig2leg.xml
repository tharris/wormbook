<title>Figure 2. Gene expression patterns in vulval cells</title>
<para>Overview of the expression profile of 11 genes in vulval cells in wild type and mutant animals as described in literature. Expression of each gene is plotted in a matrix form where X-axis represents the vulval cell type and Y-axis represents the stage of the animal.</para>
