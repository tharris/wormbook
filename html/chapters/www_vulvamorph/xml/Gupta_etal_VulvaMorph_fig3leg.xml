<title>Figure 3. Patterning of the 1&#x00B0; lineage.</title>
<para>A. Intact, wild-type 1&#x00B0; lineage has two F cells near the anchor cell and two more distal E cells. B. After AC ablation, the patterns are variable. C. In a <emphasis>lin-12(lf)</emphasis> mutant in which all ventral uterine cells but one anchor cell have been ablated, and in which <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=P7.p;class=Cell" role="_blank">P7.p</ulink> has been ablated to keep only two 1&#x00B0; lineages, there is a normal pattern at the anchor cells, but a variable distal pattern. D. Model posits an AC-mediated signal via RAS to specify vulF cells near the AC. In addition, vulE and vulF signal each other to ensure that correct fates are specified.
