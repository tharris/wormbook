<title>Figure 1. ERGO-1 and ALG-3/4 26G siRNA pathways.</title>
<para>The templates for 26G siRNA generation are ~500 mRNAs and lincRNAs. A complex containing an RdRP and DCR-1 generates 26G siRNAs in both oocytes/embryos and spermatocytes/sperm. These 26G siRNAs associate with the Argonaute proteins ERGO-1 and ALG-3/4 respectively. 22G siRNA generation is triggered and requires another RdRP and multiple cofactors. These 22G siRNAs associate with WAGO class Argonautes to silence their targets in the soma through nuclear and cytoplasmic silencing pathways.</para>
