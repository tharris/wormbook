<title>Figure 3. Nuclear RNAi pathways required for trans-generational silencing.</title>
<para>Two pathways, silencing somatic targets and germline targets, converge on the same NRDE proteins but require distinct nuclear Argonaute proteins: cytoplasmic secondary 22G siRNAs associate with NRDE-3 in the soma and with HRDE-1 in the germline. The Argonaute:siRNA complex translocates to the nucleus where it recruits NRDE-2 and NRDE-1 to the nascent pre-mRNA. NRDE-1 also associates with chromatin in a NRDE-4-dependent manner. NRDE-1 and NRDE-4 promote histone H3K9 trimethylation by histone methyltransferases and thus inhibit transcription. In addition, the NRDE proteins inhibit RNA polymerase II. Nuclear RNAi is heritable across generations: silencing signals, most likely siRNAs generated in the germline of the parent, are inherited and direct H3K9 trimethylation in the offspring. </para>
