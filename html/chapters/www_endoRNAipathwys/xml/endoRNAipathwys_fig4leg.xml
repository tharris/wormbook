<title>Figure 4. The CSR-1 22G siRNA pathway.</title>
<para>In the germline P granules, the RdRP EGO-1, in complex with the helicase DRH-3 and the Tudor domain protein EKL-1, generates 22G siRNAs from over 4000 protein-coding, germline-expressed genes. These 22G siRNAs associate with the Argonaute CSR-1. CSR-1:siRNA complexes do not silence their targets, but rather localize to chromosomes to ensure proper meiotic and mitotic chromosome segregation and to protect against silencing. The poly(U)polymerase CDE-1 regulates the abundance of CSR-1 associated 22G siRNAs by uridylation. CSR-1 is thought to protect its targets against PRG-1 recruitment.</para>
