<title>Figure 5. The 21U/piRNA pathway.</title>
<para>piRNAs are generated from two types of loci, from piRNA genes mostly found in large clusters on chromosome IV and from protein coding genes and other Pol II transcripts. These two types of loci share a common small motif, but piRNA genes show a large motif that is bound by Forkhead transcription factors and is required to drive piRNA expression. piRNAs derived from protein coding genes map to transcription start sites and may reflect promoter proximal pausing. Both types of piRNA loci produce capped 26 nt precursors that are subsequently trimmed and 2&#x2019;-O-methylated by HENN-1 to produce mature 21U RNAs. 21U RNAs associate with the Piwi proteins PRG-1/2 and trigger secondary 22G siRNA production.</para>
