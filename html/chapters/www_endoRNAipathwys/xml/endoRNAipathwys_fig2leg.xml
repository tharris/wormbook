<para>26G siRNAs and 21U/piRNAs trigger secondary 22G siRNA generation by the RdRPs RRF-1 and EGO-1, in conjunction with the helicase DRH-3 and the Tudor domain protein EKL-1. Six mutator proteins that form perinuclear Mutator foci are required for 22G siRNA production in the germline. The RDE-10/11 complex promotes secondary 22G siRNA amplification in the soma.</para>
