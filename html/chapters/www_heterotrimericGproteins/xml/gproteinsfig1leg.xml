        <para>Depicted is the activation of a heterotrimeric G protein by a G protein coupled
            receptor (GPCR). In the inactive conformation (1), the G<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;&#x03B2;&#x03B3;</symbol> heterotrimer is associated with a seven
            transmembrane-spanning receptor protein, and the G<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;</symbol> subunit is associated with GDP. Upon receptor
            activation with ligand (*), the receptor undergoes a conformational change and acts as a
            guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;</symbol> subunit, stimulating the exchange of GDP for GTP
            (2). Additional GEFs have been isolated that act on GDP associated G<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;</symbol> subunits not
            associated with receptor. Upon binding of GTP, the G<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;</symbol> subunit dissociates from the G<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B2;&#x03B3;</symbol> dimmer and these proteins are released
            from the receptor. Dissociated G<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;</symbol> and
                G<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B2;&#x03B3;</symbol> subunits then interact with a variety of
            effector (E) proteins (3). The signal is attenuated by the intrinsic ability of G<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;</symbol> subunits to hydrolyze GTP, and this activity is
            accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (4). Most GAPs contain a regulator of G
            protein signaling (RGS) domain that often displays higher affinity for the G<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x03B1;</symbol>-GTP transition state.</para>
