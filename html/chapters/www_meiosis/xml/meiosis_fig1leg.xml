<para>For simplicity, a single pair of homologous chromosomes is shown. DNA replication occurs at the onset of meiosis. During the transition zone in early meiotic prophase (leptotene and zygotene), homolog pairing is achieved and DSBs are formed. By early pachytene, SC assembly is completed, and by late pachytene, the process of homologous recombination leads to the formation of inter-homolog CO events. Following SC disassembly during late prophase, homologous chromosomes remain linked by chiasmata, physical attachments provided by COs in combination with sister chromatid cohesion. In the first meiotic division parental homologs are disjoined to reduce ploidy to the haploid state, and in the second division sister chromatids are disjoined. Recombination leads to genetic exchange as indicated by the different coloring of the chromosomes. Note: during oocyte meiosis, one of the two end products of each division gets extruded as a polar body.</para>
