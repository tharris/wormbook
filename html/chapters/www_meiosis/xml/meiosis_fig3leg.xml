<para>Model depicting the attachment of chromosomes to the nuclear envelope and their movement in transition zone nuclei. Model shows two pairs of homologous chromosomes (one pair depicted in black and a second pair depicted in brown) with their PC-bearing region associated with the nuclear envelope. See key on figure for molecular components. Inset on the left hand side of the panel shows a detailed model of the attachment site of a single chromosome. When chromosomes enter the transition zone they are connected to the nuclear envelope via interactions between PC-associated proteins (PC proteins) and a nuclear envelope-spanning SUN/KASH protein complex. Microtubule-mediated forces in the cytoplasm result in movement of these SUN/KASH complexes, causing movement of attached chromosome ends. Chromosome ends move vigorously, and tend to come together into local clusters (presumably to allow homology between adjacent chromosomes to be assessed). When homologs have identified each other and initiated pairing, the SC (depicted as thin black lines connecting the homologs) is established. Both synapsed and unsynapsed chromosomes continue to move until all chromosomes are synapsed. <emphasis role="bold">(B)</emphasis> Diagram showing the position of the PC region (grey boxes) on each chromosome and the PC-binding proteins that load to each chromosome.</para>
