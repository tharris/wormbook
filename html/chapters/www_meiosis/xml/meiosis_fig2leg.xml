<para>Projection of a dissected, three-dimensionally intact hermaphrodite germ line stained with DAPI to visualize chromatin. Stages of meiotic prophase and magnification of a representative nucleus of each meiotic prophase stage are depicted below the germ line. White lines indicate boundaries between germline regions containing nuclei at indicated stages of meiotic prophase. Left end of the germ line contains a compartment of mitotically proliferating cells followed by nuclei undergoing meiotic DNA replication (meiotic entrance). The transition zone contains nuclei in leptotene/zygotene, with chromatin tightly clustered in one half of the nucleus, giving a characteristic half-moon shape appearance. As nuclei move from the transition zone into the pachytene region, paired and aligned homologous chromosomes can be seen distributed around the periphery of each nucleus. Diplotene is characterized by chromatin condensation; at this stage, bivalents (pairs of homologous of chromosomes attached by chiasmata) become visible as 6 separate chromatin structures. Chromosome condensation continues during diakinesis, when the 6 bivalents can be easily visualized within the nucleus. Nuclei move down the gonad tube, transitioning between the stages described above with a speed of approximately one cell row per hour. Inset nuclei from the various stages of prophase I are shown to scale with each other.</para>
