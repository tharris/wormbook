<para>TEM images of nuclei from the late pachytene regions of a wild-type germ line (reproduced with permission from <link linkend="bib28">Colai&aacute;covo et al., 2003</link><!--: PMID 12967565-->). (A&rsquo;) Equatorial section of a wild-type pachytene nucleus containing a very long continuous stretch of SC, visible as a zipper-like track flanked by electron-dense patches of chromatin; the large dark body centered in the upper half of the panel is the nucleolus. (B&rsquo;) Detail of SC structure from a different wild-type nucleus. Scale bars equal 500 nm. <emphasis role="bold">(B)</emphasis> Diagram of SC structure assembled between a pair of homologous chromosomes. Note that each homolog (depicted as a pair of closely associated sister chromatids) assembles an axial element (red), and that central region components (green) link together homologous axial elements. <emphasis role="bold">(C)</emphasis> Projections of pachytene nuclei stained with anti-HIM-3 and anti-SYP-1 antibodies, counterstained with DAPI and imaged with a DeltaVision system. Note that axial elements from the homologs cannot be resolved as two separate structures since the distance between them (&lt;100 nm) is below the resolution of conventional fluorescence microscopy (200 nm). Scale bar equals 5 &micro;m<emphasis role="bold">.</emphasis></para>
