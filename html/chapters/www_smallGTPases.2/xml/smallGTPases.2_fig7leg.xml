<title>Figure 7. Vulval Ras switches effectors depending on cell position in the EGF gradient.</title><para>Two models of vulval cell fate patterning, the morphogen gradient model and the sequential induction model, were formerly considered contradictory (<link linkend="bib206">Kenyon, 1995</link><!--PMID: 7628006-->). The discovery that Ras&rarr;RalGEF&rarr;Ral mediates lower dose EGF signal to promote 2&deg; fate reconciled the two models, and the combined model is shown here. Red arrows show key points at which signals are switched from supporting one cell type to the other. <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE00274;class=Protein" role="_blank">LIN-12</ulink>/Notch is internalized and degraded in presumptive 1&deg; cells to prevent contradictory Notch signaling.

Ral promoter activity is excluded from presumptive 1&deg; but persists in presumptive 2&deg; cells, thus preventing inappropriate activation of Ral.</para>
