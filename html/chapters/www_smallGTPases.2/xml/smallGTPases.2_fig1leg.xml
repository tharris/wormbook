<title>Figure 1. A dendrogram of the <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> small GTPases.</title><para>The Ras superfamily consists of the Ras, Rho, Rab, and Arf families, with Ran comprising its family of one. The core GTPase domain is the unifying feature of this group, while N- and C-terminal extensions are much less conserved and could distort alignments. Thus only the core GTPase domain was used for the alignment and generation of this rooted tree (via Clustal X, with trees generated in FigTree).</para>
