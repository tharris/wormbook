Effector-binding region of human vs. <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> Rho family members.</title><para>The entire effector-binding region of human and <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> proteins was aligned. The core sequence, thought to govern direct protein-protein interactions, is underlined. Core residues not conserved in the subfamily are bolded and blue. Human orthologs are listed above <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> orthologs. <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> protein names have a dash and number. Some human proteins have alternate names (see <link linkend="table1">Table 1</link>).</para>
