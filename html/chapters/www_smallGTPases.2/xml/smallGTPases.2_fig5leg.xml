<title>Figure 5. Effector-binding region of human vs. <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> Ras family members.</title><para>The entire effector-binding region of human and <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> proteins was aligned. The core sequence, thought to govern direct protein-protein interactions, is underlined. Core residues not conserved in the subfamily are bolded and blue, and the <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE39342;class=Protein" role="_blank">DRN-1</ulink> insertion is bolded and red. Human orthologs are listed above <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> orthologs. <emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> protein names have a dash and number. Some human proteins have alternate names (see <link linkend="table1">Table 1</link>, <link linkend="sec9">Section 9</link>).</para>
