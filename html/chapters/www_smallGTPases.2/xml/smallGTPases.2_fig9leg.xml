<title>Figure 9. Alignment of human and Caenorhabditid Di-Ras subfamily predicted N-termini.</title><para>GTPase domain sequences are in blue, established mammalian sequences in black, the inferred <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WP:CE39342;class=Protein" role="_blank">DRN-1</ulink> N-terminal extension in purple, and ambiguous further N-terminal extension in gray. Dileucine repeats are bolded. Di-Ras3 (ARHI, Noey2) has an N-terminal extension containing three dileucine motifs. Assuming a non-AUG initiation codon, transcript <emphasis role="italic">C54A12.4.2</emphasis>, predicted by RNAseq, aligns with upstream genomic sequence in <emphasis role="italic">C. briggsae</emphasis> (Cbr) and <emphasis role="italic">C. brenneri</emphasis> (Cbn), all of which could start with a dileucine repeat. Hypothetical translation of the overlapping transcript <emphasis role="italic">C54A12.4.1</emphasis> also contains a dileucine, but it precedes a stop codon and so it may be a computational artifact. Detailed analysis of the <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00016911;class=Gene" role="_blank">drn-1</ulink></emphasis> gene structure may resolve these questions.</para>
