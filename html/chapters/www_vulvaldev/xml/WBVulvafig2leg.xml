        <para>Left lateral views of larval hermaphrodites (anterior to the left). AC, anchor cell. 3, 3<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> VPCs (P4.p and P8.p shown here); 2, 2<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> VPCs (P5.p and P7.p); 1, 1<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> VPC. (A) mid-L3 stage . At this stage, there are no signs of morphological differentiation but P6.p and its daughters express <emphasis>egl-17</emphasis>. B. L3 lethargus. The first two rounds of mitosis of the 2<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> and 1<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> vulval precursors are drawn in, with the axis of the third round of division indicated: L, longitudinal (anterior-posterior); T, transverse (left-right); N, no division; S, fuses with hyp7 epidermal syncytium. In the literature, 1<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> lineages are referred to as [TTTT] or [EFFE]; 2<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> lineages are referred to as [LLTN], [NTLL], [ABCD], or [DCBA]; 3<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> lineages as [S S]; hybrid lineages are [S TN], [NT S], [S TT], [TT S], [LL S] or [S LL]. In abnormal lineages, O refers to an oblique axis of division, and U refers to undivided cell.</para>
