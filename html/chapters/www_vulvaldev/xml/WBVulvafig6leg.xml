        <title>Figure 6. Pattern of VPC fates and main defects in induction</title>
        <para>Ablation (indicated by black star) of the gonad or of the anchor cell results in a vulvaless phenotype with all six VPCs having 3<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> fates. Vulvaless animals have an anchor cell but vulval induction does not occur, resulting in a vulvaless phenotype. Multivulva mutants have more than three VPCs generating vulval progeny. Many have all six VPCs becoming 1<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> or 2<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> even in the absence of the anchor cell or gonad. Yellow, 3<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> fate; red, 2<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> fate; blue, 1<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> fate.</para>
