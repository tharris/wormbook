          <title>Figure 17. Patterning of the 1<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> lineage</title>
          <para>A. Model posits a signal via RAS to specify vulF cells near the anchor cell. B. Intact, wild-type 1<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> lineage has two F cells near the anchor cell and two E cells more distal. C. After AC ablation, the patterns are variable. D. In a <emphasis>lin-12(lf)</emphasis> mutant in which all ventral uterine cells but one anchor cell have been ablated, and in which P7.p has been ablated to keep only two 1<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> lineages, there is a normal pattern at the anchor cells, but a variable pattern more distal.
