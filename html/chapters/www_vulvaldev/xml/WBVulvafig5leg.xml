        <title>Figure 5. Roles of LIN-39</title>
        <para>
            <emphasis>lin-39</emphasis> is positively regulated by WNT and LET-23 signaling, and is proposed to be inhibited by MAB-5 (see <xref linkend="figure3" />). LIN-39 regulates proliferation, responsiveness to LIN-3 and inhibits fusion with hyp7 via inhibition of EFF-1 expression. These events are occurring in the VPCs; transduction of the Wnt signal occurs in the VPCs, but the source of the Wnt signal is unknown. Green arrows, positive regulation; red bars, negative regulation.</para>
