        <title>Figure 1. Vulval development is a multi-step process</title>
        <para>It involves the coordinated development of the uterine (green, top) and ventral epithelia (purple, bottom) with several interactions between these tissues. 1. The six VPCs are specified from among the ventral epidermal Pn.p cells. 2. The VPCs become specified to 1<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol>, 2<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> or 3<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> cell fates by multiple signaling pathways. The anchor cell induces vulval fates (1<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> and 2<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol>) and lateral signaling among the induced VPCs specifies the 2<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> VPC fate. 3. The vulval lineages are generated and specific sets of mature cells are produced and specified. 4. The anchor cell breaks down the basement membrane of the gonad and vulval epithelia and invades between the vulF cells. 5. The vulval cells undergo a complex morphogenesis.<emphasis role="bold">A.</emphasis> The anchor cell becomes specified from a set of two AC/VU cells; the cell that is not the anchor cell becomes one of three VU precursor cells. <emphasis role="bold">B.</emphasis> The three VU cells generate 12 grandprogeny, six of which are induced by the anchor cell to become pi cells. The six pi cells divide, and four of their progeny are induced by the vulF cells of the vulva 1<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> lineage to become uv1 cells. The remaining eight cells fuse to form the utse, which ultimately fuses with the anchor cell.</para>
