        <title>Figure 12. Synthetic multivulva mutants suggest signaling from hyp7 to VPCs</title>
        <para>
            <emphasis>lin-15b</emphasis>, <emphasis>lin-35</emphasis> and
            <emphasis>lin-37</emphasis> have been argued to act in hyp7 while
            <emphasis>lin-36</emphasis> has been argued to act in the VPCs. These proteins where
            known are nuclear and presumably regulate gene expression (green arrows), although the
            physiological targets are unknown (unknown genes) as is the sign of the regulation.
            Epistasis analysis suggests that the synMuv genes somehow act negatively on LET-23
            signaling (red bars) thereby inhibiting the specification of 1<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> and 2<symbol role="symbolfont">&#x00B0;</symbol> VPC fates.</para>
