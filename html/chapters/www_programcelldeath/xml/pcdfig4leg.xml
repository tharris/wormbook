        <title>Figure 4. Molecular model for the cell corpse engulfment process</title>
        <para>The engulfment process is mediated by two partially redundant pathways. In the
            CED-1/CED-6/CED-7 pathway, CED-1 and CED-7 act on the surface of the engulfing cell to
            mediate recognition of an unknown engulfment signal(s) on the surface of the dying cell
            (green diamonds) and to transduce the signal through CED-6 to activate the phagocytic
            machinery of the engulfing cell. CED-7 also acts in dying cells. In the CED-2, CED-5,
            CED-10 and CED-12 pathway, PSR-1 may act in the engulfing cell to mediate the
            recognition of PS (red circles) externalized by the dying cell and to transduce the
            signal through the CED-2/CED-5/CED-12 ternary complex to activate CED-10. There are
            likely other engulfment receptors that act in the CED-2, CED-5, CED-10 and CED-12
            pathway.</para>
