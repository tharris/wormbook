        <title>Figure 3. Biochemical model for the activation of programmed cell death</title>
        <para>(A) In living cells, CED-4 is tethered to the surface of mitochondria through binding
            to CED-9. (B) In cells that are doomed to die, the death initiator EGL-1 binds to CED-9,
            causes a major CED-9 conformational change, and triggers the disassociation of CED-4
            from CED-9. (C) Released CED-4 proteins translocate to perinuclear membranes and undergo
            oligomerization, which brings two CED-3 proenzymes to close proximity. (D) CED-3
            proenzymes undergo autoproteolytic activation. </para>
