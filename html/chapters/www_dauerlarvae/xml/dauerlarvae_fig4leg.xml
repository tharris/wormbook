<title>Figure 4. Cuticles of L3 and dauer larvae.</title>
<para>(A, B) The lateral cuticle of an L3-staged larva imaged with DIC optics (A), or diagrammed (B). Annulae (arrows) are faintly apparent as ridges running perpendicular to the anterior-posterior axis. (C, D) The lateral cuticle of a dauer larva imaged with DIC optics (C), or diagrammed (D). Broad dauer alae (arrowheads) are clearly visible running parallel to the anterior-posterior axis. DIC images were taken at the identical magnification (630X), highlighting the radial constriction of the dauer larva. Anterior is to the left.</para>
