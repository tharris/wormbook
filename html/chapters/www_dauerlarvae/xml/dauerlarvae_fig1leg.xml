<title>Figure 1. Dauer and continuous life histories.</title>
<para><emphasis role="italic">C. elegans</emphasis> can develop through distinct life histories, depending on environmental conditions. Favorable environments including plentiful food, sparse population, and moderate temperatures promote continuous development (left). Adverse environments including inadequate food, high population density, and elevated temperatures promote dauer development (right). Environmental conditions are assessed at the L1 and L2 stages. Green arrows indicate developmental progression in favorable conditions; red arrows indicate developmental progression (or arrest) in adverse conditions. Dauer development is delayed relative to continuous development, such that dauer larvae form at approximately the same chronological time as continuously developing larvae reach the L4 stage. All stages shown are separated by molts, except there is no molt between dauer and PDL3. See text for more details. PD = post-dauer.</para>
