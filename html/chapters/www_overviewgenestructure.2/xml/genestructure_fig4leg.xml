<title>Figure 4. Distribution of CDS sizes.</title>
<para>This is the lengths of the CDS coding regions of genes from the START codon to the STOP codon (inclusive) without the introns. Data was obtained from <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/">WormBase</ulink> release WS237. Each data point represents the number of CDSs in each size class in increments of 100 bp. Where there are several CDS isoforms in a gene, they are all counted.</para>
