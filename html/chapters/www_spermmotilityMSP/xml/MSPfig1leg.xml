        <title>Figure 1. Spermatogenesis and MSP</title>
        <para>Shown are various stages in sperm cell development. In primary spermatocytes, MSP
            (red) begins to assemble as paracrystalline arrays in fibrous bodies associated with the
            membranous organelles (purple). Assembly continues through the secondary spermatocyte
            stage. The fibrous body-membranous organelle complexes segregate into the spermatids
            and, following separation from the residual body (RB), MSP dissociates into the cytosol.
            Upon activation, MSP reassembles into filamentous fibers in the pseudopod.</para>
