        <para>(A) MSP monomer. Backbone trace demonstrates the seven-stranded immunoglobulin-like
            fold. (B) MSP dimer. Sidechains involved in dimer formation are shown in red. (C) MSP
            subfilament. Sidechains involved in subfilament interaction between two dimers are shown
            in green. Structure coordinates are available as entry 1GRW from the Protein Data Bank.</para>
