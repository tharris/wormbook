<para>Autophagy begins with the formation of the phagophore or isolation membrane (vesicle nucleation step). The concerted action of the autophagy core machinery proteins at the phagophore assembly site (PAS) is thought to lead to the expansion of the phagophore into an autophagosome (vesicle elongation). The autophagosome can engulf bulk cytoplasm nonspecifically, including entire organelles, or target cargos specifically. When the outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with an endosome (forming an amphisome before fusing with the lysosome) or directly with a lysosome (docking and fusion steps), it forms an autophagolysosome. Finally, the sequestered material is degraded inside the autophagolyosome (vesicle breakdown and degradation) and recycled.</para>
