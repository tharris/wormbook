<sect1 id="sec1">
<title><emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> is a genus of parasitic nematodes</title>
<para><emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> is a genus containing some 50 species of obligate gastrointestinal parasites of vertebrates (<link linkend="bib66">Speare, 1989</link>). <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> infects mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians. Where investigated, most species appear to be able to infect one, or at most a very few, host species. Indeed, in many cases the specific designation may have been attributed largely by the host species in which the parasite was found. This degree of host-species specificity is not unusual among animal parasitic nematodes.</para>
<para>For most nematodes that parasitise the vertebrate gastrointestinal tract, male and female worms live in the host gut and the females lay eggs which pass out of the host in faeces. Depending on the species, these eggs, or infective larvae that develop from them, are eaten (eggs or larvae) or penetrate host skin (larvae) to achieve transmission to a new host. There is then a period of larval migration within the new host before new adults establish in the gut. <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> follows this basic plan, but with significant differences. Female-only adult worms form the parasitic stages of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis>. In addition, there is a dioecious adult generation that occurs outside of the host (<link linkend="bib63">Schad, 1989</link>). This free-living adult generation is almost unique among nematode parasites of vertebrates. Originally the parasitic and free-living adult generations of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> were described as distinct species of <emphasis>Anguillula</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib10">Bavay, 1876</link>; <link linkend="bib11">Bavay, 1877</link>) until they were discovered to be separate stages of one life-cycle when they were brought together as <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib31">Grassi, 1879</link>).</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sec2">
<title><emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> infection of humans</title>
<para>Two species of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> infect humans, <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. fuelleborni</emphasis>. <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> has a cosmopolitan distribution in tropical and subtropical regions (<link linkend="bib63">Schad, 1989</link>). <emphasis>S. fuelleborni</emphasis> occurs in African primates where infection can be shared with humans (<link linkend="bib59">Pampiglione and Ricciardi, 1972</link>; <link linkend="bib38">Hira and Patel, 1980</link><!--:PMID 7394891-->). <emphasis>S. fuelleborni kellyi</emphasis> occurs exclusively in humans in New Guinea (<link linkend="bib5">Ashford and Barnish 1989</link>; <link linkend="bib6">Ashford et al., 1992</link><!--:PMID 15463651-->). It is estimated that some 100-200 million individuals are infected worldwide with <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis>, however these infections can be difficult to detect, so these may be underestimates (<link linkend="bib16">Crompton, 1987</link>; <link linkend="bib1">Albonico et al., 1999</link>). For comparison, global human infection with the gastro-intestinal nematodes <emphasis>Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura</emphasis> and hookworms (<emphasis>Ancylostoma duodenale</emphasis> and <emphasis>Necator americanus</emphasis>) are 1.4, 1.0 and 1.4 billion, respectively (<link linkend="bib1">Albonico et al., 1999</link>).</para>
<para>In normal healthy individuals, infection with <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> causes rather little overt pathology (<link linkend="bib26">Genta and Caymmi Gomes, 1989</link>; <link linkend="bib32">Grove, 1989a</link>), but may compromise an individual&apos;s nutritional status (<link linkend="bib67">Stephenson et al., 2000</link><!--:PMID 11386688-->). However, <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> infection in immunocompromised individuals (particularly following the administration of steroids, for example following transplant surgery) can result in disseminated strongyloidiasis, in which worms move beyond the confines of the gut into other organs (see <link linkend="sec5">section 5</link>, below; <link linkend="bib32">Grove 1989a</link>). This is fatal unless anti-<emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> therapy is given. <emphasis>S. fuelleborni kellyi</emphasis> is also the aetiological agent of swollen baby (or belly) syndrome in New Guinea, in which neo-natal infants acquire overwhelming intestinal infections which can also disseminate (<link linkend="bib5">Ashford and Barnish, 1989</link>). This is also fatal in the absence of anti-<emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> therapy.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sec3">
<title><emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> in the wild</title>
<para><emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> is a relatively common infection of wild and domestic animals. Although it is difficult to generalise, the prevalence (i.e., the proportion of a population that is infected) of <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> infections of humans is often up to 5% in endemic areas with this typically concentrated in younger individuals (which is common for many soil transmitted helminths), with the occasional occurrence of higher prevalence. In a study of rats in the UK the prevalence of <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> was 62% (<link linkend="bib22">Fisher and Viney, 1998</link><!--:PMID 9608730-->). The relative difficulty of detection of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> infections, affects the accuracy of reported estimates of prevalence.</para>
<para><emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> infections can be detected by examination of host faeces for <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> eggs or larvae or by examination of the small intestine of a host for parasitic females.</para>
<para><emphasis>Faeces.</emphasis> In freshly isolated faeces direct examination of a thick smear will reveal eggs and, or L1 stages. The eggs are ellipsoid, 40&#x02013;85&#x003BC;m in length, with a thin wall containing a larva (see <link linkend="figure1">Figure 1</link>). This morphology identifies the eggs as <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis>; the presence of larvae in fresh faeces is also diagnostic of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> infection. The stage (eggs or larvae) present in faeces is a species-specific character (see <link linkend="figure1">Figure 1</link>). In this way, for example, <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. fuelleborni</emphasis> infections can be differentiated by the presence of larvae or eggs, respectively.</para>

<para>Faeces can be sampled by collection of fresh faeces from the ground, by collection directly from the rectum (of large domestic animals) or, for humans, from volunteered stool samples. Direct examination of faeces can diagnose relatively high intensity (i.e., a large number of worms <emphasis>per</emphasis> host) <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> infections. For lower intensity infections, larvae can be collected from a greater faecal mass by the use of a Baermann funnel (see <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_strongyloides/strongyloides.html" role="_blank"><emphasis>Strongyloides stercoralis</emphasis>: a model for translational research on parasitic nematode biology</ulink>) or by nematode egg concentration techniques on formalin preserved stool samples. Faecal samples can also be grown in faecal cultures, from which infective L3s can be obtained (see <link linkend="sec8">section 8</link>, below and see <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_strongyloides/strongyloides.html" role="_blank"><emphasis>Strongyloides stercoralis</emphasis>: a model for translational research on parasitic nematode biology</ulink>). The infective L3 morphology (see <link linkend="sec4">section 4</link>, below) will identify <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> larvae.</para>
<para>It is important to examine fresh faeces for two reasons (<link linkend="bib5">Ashford and Barnish, 1989</link>). Firstly, <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> eggs rapidly hatch to release larvae, and so examination of fresh faeces allows proper determination of the stage passed in faeces. Secondly, faeces collected from the ground can be rapidly contaminated by free-living nematodes, making the subsequent identification and collection of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> larvae more difficult.</para>
<para><emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> parasitic females can be observed in the small intestine of infected hosts. This, obviously, requires the sacrifice of the host. <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> parasitic females are, in general, concentrated in the upper half-to-third of the small intestine. Direct microscopical examination can reveal parasitic females or, more usually, the trails of dark eggs left behind the female as she migrates through the intestinal mucosa (see <link linkend="figure2">Figure 2</link>). To do this the intestine is opened longitudinally and the luminal contents removed; more easy viewing can be achieved by squashing the open small intestine between two glass plates, which are then examined microscopically (<link linkend="bib83">Wilkes et al., 2004</link><!--:PMID 15206469-->). Live parasitic females can be obtained by vertically suspending longitudinally opened intestines in media (<link linkend="bib83">Wilkes et al., 2004</link><!--:PMID 15206469-->).</para>

<sect1 id="sec4">
<title>Phylogeny, morphology and taxonomy</title>
<para>Nematode phylogenetic reconstruction based on rRNA SSU places <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> (Rhabditida, Strongyloididae; <link linkend="bib3">Anderson, 2000</link>) in clade IVa, which is a sister clade to plant parasitic and invertebrate parasitic nematodes (clade IVb; <link linkend="bib13">Blaxter et al., 1998</link><!--:PMID 951024-->). <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (Rhabditida, Rhabditidae) is in clade V together with other parasitic nematodes (order Strongyloida). Therefore the taxonomic arrangement of <emphasis>Caenorhabditis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> is not consistent with the reconstructed phylogeny. Note the difference between the taxonomic order Strongyloida and the family Strongyloidea (order Rhabditida), which contains <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> spp.; a potential source of great confusion.</para>

<para><emphasis>Parastrongyloides</emphasis> is the sister genus to <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib20">Dorris et al., 2002</link><!--:PMID 12392916-->). <emphasis>Parastrongyloides</emphasis> has a similar life-cycle to <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> except that there are parasitic males as well as females, and the free-living forms are able to go through multiple, sequential generations outside of the host, apparently indefinitely (see <link linkend="sec5">section 5</link>, below; <link linkend="bib29">Grant et al., 2006a</link><!--:PMID 1650065-->). <emphasis>Parastrongyloides</emphasis> was first described from moles but is more widely known from Australasian marsupials (<link linkend="bib57">Morgan, 1928</link>; <link linkend="bib50">Mackerras, 1959</link>).</para>
<para>Molecular phylogenetic analysis of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> has suggested the existence of two clades within the genus (<link linkend="bib20">Dorris et al., 2002</link><!--:PMID 12392916-->). This analysis has not been able to separate morphologically defined species, including <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. fuelleborni.</emphasis></para>
<para>The morphology of the parasitic and free-living phases of the life-cycle differs. The parasitic females are approximately 2mm in length, with blunt-ended tails, and an elongated, straight-sided (filariform) oesophagus, occupying approximately one third of the body length (see <link linkend="figure3">Figure 3</link>; <link linkend="bib66">Speare, 1989</link>). The ovary is didelphic and opens at the vulva which is positioned approximately two thirds along the body length. The free-living adults stages are approximately 1mm in length, with the female slightly larger than the male (see <link linkend="figure4">Figure 4</link>). Both sexes have a rhabditiform oesophagus; the free-living female has a didelphic ovary and a vulva at the mid-point of the body (<link linkend="bib66">Speare, 1989</link>). The general structure, organisation and appearance of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> free-living females and <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> hermaphrodites are similar. Infective L3s, the hypothesised analogue of dauer larvae of free-living nematodes (<link linkend="bib39">Hotez et al., 1993</link><!--:PMID 15463660-->), are, like <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> dauer larvae, radially constricted, with a filariform oesophagus approximately half the length of the larva (see <link linkend="figure5">Figure 5</link>). These larvae have a tripartite pointed tail which when viewed with a dissecting microscope appears like a simple fork (see <link linkend="figure5">Figure 5</link>); these larvae are highly active in liquid following gentle agitation.</para>

<para>There are a number of characters used for species identification. For the parasitic females these are the disposition of the ovaries (parallel to or spiralled around the intestine); the <emphasis>en face</emphasis> view of the stoma (<link linkend="bib47">Little, 1966</link><!--:PMID 5929983-->); the stage passed in host faeces (i.e., eggs, larvae, or eggs and larvae) and more recently, the morphology of the peri-vulval lateral cuticle (<link linkend="bib66">Speare,1989</link>; <link linkend="bib77">Viney and Ashford, 1990</link><!--:PMID 2338480-->). Morphometric comparison of body size and the relative position of various structures is also used extensively. The means of recovery of these parasitic stages (e.g., collection from intestine or from faeces following host anthelminthic therapy) as well as the effects of the host immune response on the morphology of <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> parasitic females (e.g., <link linkend="bib43">Kimura et al., 1999</link><!--:PMID 10466130-->), will reduce the utility of these morphometric approaches.</para>
<para>For the free-living adult males and females, morphometrics are also important, as too is the arrangement of the peri-cloacal papillae of the male (<link linkend="bib66">Speare, 1989</link>). The forked tail of the infective L3s is a particularly clear diagnostic character for <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> (see <link linkend="figure5">Figure 5</link>), which allows easy allows differentiation from other nematodes that may contaminate faecal samples.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sec5">
<title>The life-cycle</title>
<para>The life-cycle of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> is both complicated and somewhat tricky to understand, but also one part of the fascination of the genus. This description is primarily based on the life-cycle of <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> (a parasite of the rat), which has been extensively studied; some of these details are likely to vary in other species.</para>
<para>Hosts become infected when free-living infective L3s penetrate the skin. Naturally this occurs by the chance coming together of host skin and larvae, though this is facilitated by dispersal and nictation behaviours of the larvae. In the laboratory this comes about by the deliberate application of infective L3s to host skin or by subcutaneous injection (<link linkend="bib72">Tindall and Wilson, 1988</link><!--:PMID 340564-->). These larvae migrate through the host body, such that from 24 hours post infection (p.i.) they are found in the naso-frontal region of the host, from where they are, presumably, swallowed to reach the small intestine (<link linkend="bib72">Tindall and Wilson, 1988</link><!--:PMID 340564-->). This naso-frontal route of migration has been most thoroughly determined in <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis>; in other species of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> (and other genera of skin-penetrating nematodes) migration through the lungs is also thought to be important. During this migration they moult via an L4 stage so that there are adult parasitic female worms present in the gut from approximately 4 days p.i., with reproduction commencing shortly thereafter, detected by the presence of eggs and, or larvae in the faeces (<link linkend="bib43">Kimura et al., 1999</link><!--:PMID 10466130-->).</para>
<para>In the host faeces the eggs hatch to release first-stage larvae (L1; see <link linkend="figure6">Figure 6</link>). These L1s have alternative potential developmental fates. In one fate they develop <emphasis>via</emphasis> L2 - L4 stages into rhabditiform male and female worms; this is the free-living adult generation. This type of development is known as indirect, sexual or heterogonic development. The free-living adults mate and the female lays eggs which hatch to release L1s which moult <emphasis>via</emphasis> an L2 into infective filariform L3 stages. These infective L3 stages are long lived and can persist in the environment until they encounter a suitable host. Their behaviour is to move away from the host faeces in which they have developed, a behaviour which is likely to enhance their probability of finding a host.</para>
<para>The alternative fate of the L1s that hatch from eggs passed in faeces is that they moult <emphasis>via</emphasis> an L2 into infective L3s. This type of development is known as direct, asexual or homogonic development. Infective L3s that have developed <emphasis>via</emphasis> the direct or indirect route are, apparently, the same.</para>
<para>For most <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> species only one free-living adult generation occurs. However, up to nine (decreasingly fecund) free-living generations have been observed for <emphasis>S. planiceps</emphasis>, though in the same study <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> had only one free-living adult generation (<link linkend="bib84">Yamada et al., 1991</link><!--:PMID 1865267-->). <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> therefore differs from its relative <emphasis>Parastrongyloides</emphasis> which has apparently unlimited successive free-living generations (<link linkend="bib29">Grant et al., 2006a</link><!--:PMID 1650065-->).</para>
<para>The free-living adult generation of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> (and <emphasis>Parastrongyloides</emphasis>) is therefore rather similar to the life-cycle of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, i.e., L1 - L4 stages that develop into free-living adults, which mate to produce eggs and L1 progeny. However, the major difference is that the progeny of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> spp. free-living adults develop into infective L3s, the hypothesised analogue of dauer larvae (<link linkend="bib39">Hotez et al., 1993</link><!--;PMID 15463660-->).</para>

<para><emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> can undergo autoinfection, that is, repeated generations of development in the same host individual. Autoinfection appears to be unique to <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> within the genus (and also essentially unique among other genera of gastrointestinal parasites of vertebrates) and largely accounts for it being a serious pathogen of humans. Autoinfection involves accelerated development by larval progeny of parasitic females such that they develop into infective L3s within the gut, which then penetrate directly into the tissues of the primary host. Thus here, the entire life-cycle is completed within a host and there are no stages external to the host. Autoinfection may result in dissemination of L3 through many organs and tissues of the host, as well as the establishment of new parasitic females in the gut. In the absence of treatment, subsequent rounds of autoinfection are possible, resulting in fulminant expansion of parasite populations and multi-organ involvement with potentially fatal consequences for the host (<link linkend="bib41">Igra-Siegman et al., 1981</link><!--:PMID 7025145-->). Groups at risk of such so-called disseminated <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> infections, include patients who are immunocompromised as a result of corticosteroid therapy, various neoplasms or infection with the human T lymphotropic virus-1 (<link linkend="bib14">Carvalho and Da Fonseca Porta, 2004</link><!--:PMID 157716843-->; <link linkend="bib46">Lim et al., 2004</link><!--:PMID 15337730-->).</para>
<para>A prominent and intriguing subgroup of disseminated strongyloidiasis cases are of former far-east prisoners of war (World War II) who now reside in Europe, Australasian or North America and present with the disease as much as 50 years after leaving the endemic area. Corticosteroid therapy and, or concurrent cancer treatment are common features of these cases (<link linkend="bib28">Gill et al., 2004</link>; <link linkend="bib27">Gill and Bell, 1979</link><!--:PMID 497706-->). The onset of disseminated strongyloidiasis decades after the last possible exposure to the parasite is extremely serious for elderly patients. But, this also makes clear a salient feature of the infection biology of <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis>, namely the capacity to maintain exceedingly chronic infections in hosts. Such hyperchronic infections usually go undiagnosed due to the paucity or absence of larvae in the faeces. Alternative hypotheses for the chronicity of these infections are that either there are dormant larvae in the tissues or senescent, non-reproductive female worms in the intestine, with immunosuppression triggering either reactivation of dormant larvae or resumption of egg laying by barren parasitic females. Data from studies conducted over a relatively short time frame (77 days) in experimentally infected dogs favour the latter mechanism involving resumed oviposition by barren female worms (<link linkend="bib51">Mansfield et al., 1996</link><!--:PMID 9025687-->).</para>
<para>Hypobiosis or dormancy of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> L3s may or may not be central to the maintenance of chronic infections, but it is key to another mode of transmission: transmammary transmission. There is evidence of transmammary transmission in <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. venezuelensis</emphasis> in rats (<link linkend="bib58">Nolan and Katz, 1981</link>; <link linkend="bib42">Kawanabe et al., 1988</link><!--:PMID 3205871-->), <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> in dogs (<link linkend="bib65">Shoop et al., 2002</link><!--:PMID 12099422-->), <emphasis>S. fuelleborni kellyi</emphasis> in humans (<link linkend="bib6">Ashford et al., 1992</link><!--:PMID 15463651-->) and several species affecting livestock including <emphasis>S. ransomi</emphasis> in swine (<link linkend="bib68">Stewart et al., 1976</link><!--:PMID 1275338-->), <emphasis>S. westeri</emphasis> in horses (<link linkend="bib49">Lyons, 1994</link>) and <emphasis>S. papillosus</emphasis> in ruminants (<link linkend="bib55">Moncol and Grice, 1974</link>). Infective L3s transmitted by the transmammary route presumably arrest their development and migration in the mammary glands, and then re-activate at lactation. Transmammary transmission also occurs in other parasitic nematodes that have a phase of within-host tissue migration during their life cycles, including ascarid roundworms and hookworms (<link linkend="bib64">Shoop and Corkum, 1987</link><!--: PMD3572644-->; <link linkend="bib69">Stone and Smith, 1973</link><!--:PMID 4598107-->).</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sec6">
<title>Sex determination and genetics of the life-cycle</title>
<para>Sex determination in <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> is an XX/X0, female/ male system. XX parasitic females produce XX female and X0 male larvae (<link linkend="bib37">Harvey and Viney, 2001</link><!--:PMID 1151444-->). It is not known whether this system of sex determination relies on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, as occurs in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, or whether it relies simply on the absolute number of X chromosomes. The male larvae develop into free-living males only. The XX female larvae have an environmentally determined choice, between developing into free living adult females or into infective L3s. These XX infective L3s develop into parasitic females directly. XX free-living females and X0 free-living males mate, and produce XX, female-only infective L3 progeny, which can develop into parasitic females (<link linkend="bib37">Harvey and Viney, 2001</link><!--:PMID 1151444-->). Therefore, as a consequence of some process acting either during male gametogenesis or at fertilisation, all progeny inherit the paternal X chromosome (see <link linkend="figure6">Figure 6</link>).</para>
<para>The sex ratio of <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> is highly variable between different isolates, ranging from apparently nearly all female to 20 - 50 % male and this can change over time (see <link linkend="sec7">section 7</link>, below; <link linkend="bib78">Viney et al., 1992</link><!--:PMID 1469259-->; <link linkend="bib36">Harvey et al., 2000</link><!--:PMID 11416909-->). This is in contrast to the generally highly female biased sex ratio of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, which perhaps suggests that the mechanisms that control the sex ratio in these two genera are different (<link linkend="bib37">Harvey and Viney, 2001</link><!--:PMID 1151444-->).</para>
<para>The parasitic females of <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> reproduce parthenogenetically (<link linkend="bib75">Viney, 1994</link><!--:PMID 780041-->). This parthenogenesis is genetically mitotic, as shown by the absence of allelic segregation. Thus, the female progeny of a parasitic female are identical to each and to their mother. Formally, this parthenogenesis may occur either by mitotic parthenogenesis or by types of meiotic parthenogenesis (in which meiosis is modified to restore the diploid state) in which allelic segregation does not occur (<link linkend="bib40">Hughes, 1989</link>). Single parasitic female infections can therefore give rise to isofemale lines (<link linkend="bib78">Viney et al., 1992</link><!--:PMID 1469259-->). The free-living adult generation of <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. papillosus</emphasis> reproduces by conventional sexual reproduction (<link linkend="bib79">Viney et al., 1993</link><!--:PMID 8108454-->; <link linkend="bib21">Eberhardt et al., 2007</link><!--;PMID 17324432-->). The maximum life-time fecundity of <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> free-living females is less than 40 (<link linkend="bib23">Gardner et al., 2004</link><!--:PMID 15489049-->).</para>
<para>There has been extensive cytological investigation of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis>, investigating both sex determination and means of reproduction of the parasitic and free-living adult generations (e.g., <link linkend="bib73">Triantaphyllou and Moncol, 1977</link><!--:PMID 59205-->; <link linkend="bib2">Albertson et al., 1979</link><!--:PMID 533664-->). The genetic analysis of <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. papillosus</emphasis> and the cytological analyses of many species do not agree. This suggests that the carefully observed and recorded cytology may not reliably reveal the genetics of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis>.</para>

<title>Controlling the life-cycle</title>
<para>The extent to which indirect (or heterogonic) and direct (or homogonic) development occur in the free-living phases of the <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> life-cycle depends on the sex ratio of the free-living generation and on a range of environmental conditions. Again, these phenomena are most thoroughly understood for <emphasis>S. ratti.</emphasis> For <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis>, the developmental choice of XX female larvae is affected by environmental conditions. For example, the temperature at which faeces containing developing larvae is held external to the host affects development, such that female larvae preferentially develop into free-living adult females (indirect development) at higher temperatures (<link linkend="bib76">Viney, 1996</link><!--:PMID 8728983-->). It is probable that many other environmental factors (e.g., food quantity and quality) may have similar effects. There has been extensive investigation of a wide range of factors for a number of species (<link linkend="bib4">Arizono, 1976</link>; <link linkend="bib56">Moncol and Triantaphyllou, 1978</link><!--:PMID 25317-->; <link linkend="bib53">Minematsu et al., 1989</link><!--:PMID 273837-->; see <link linkend="figure6">Figure 6</link>).</para>
<para>For <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis>, the immune status of the host from which developing larvae are passed also affects the development of the free-living larvae. This occurs in two ways. Firstly, XX female larvae preferentially develop into adult free-living females (indirect development) when passed from hosts mounting an anti-<emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> immune response (<link linkend="bib25">Gemmill et al., 1997</link>; <link linkend="bib36">Harvey et al., 2000</link><!--:PMID 11416909-->). In addition, the sex ratio of larvae passed from hosts mounting such an immune response becomes more male biased (<link linkend="bib36">Harvey et al., 2000</link><!--:PMID 11416909-->). The combined effect of the host immune response is therefore that comparatively more free-living adult males and females develop.</para>
<para>There is yet further complexity. XX female larvae are comparatively more sensitive to environmental temperature (measured as their developmental response) when passed from hosts mounting an anti-<emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> response. The effect of the host immune response and its interaction with environmental conditions, is that indirect development is favoured by larvae passed from hosts mounting an anti-<emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> immune response (<link linkend="bib36">Harvey et al., 2000</link><!--:PMID 11416909-->).</para>
<para>There are some interesting implications of this sophisticated control of these developmental choices. Firstly, the mechanism by which an apparently environmental feature (the host immune response) affects the sex ratio of the progeny is not known. It is also not clear how developing larvae measure the host immune response and, or how this measurement is &#x02018;remembered&#x02019; through time, since the host immune response is, presumably, measured within the host, yet the developmental consequences occur later, and outside of the host (<link linkend="bib80">Viney, 2002</link>; <link linkend="bib17">Crook and Viney, 2005</link><!--:PMID 16178360-->).</para>
<para>For <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis>, there is extensive inter-isolate variation in the predominant nature of the development of the free-living generation. For example, isolates of <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> from the UK show an almost 100% homogonic development (<link linkend="bib78">Viney et al., 1992</link><!--:PMID 146925-->). Such inter-isolate variation implies that there is extensive variation in the sex ratio of the progeny of the parasitic female generation and, or in the sensitivity of larvae to environmental conditions. The degree of direct and indirect development can be artificially selected (<link linkend="bib76">Viney, 1996</link><!--:PMID 8728983-->).</para>
<para>The hypothesised analogy between the dauer larvae of free-living nematodes and infective L3 stages of parasitic nematodes has been noted before (<link linkend="bib62">Riddle and Albert, 1997</link>; <link linkend="bib39">Hotez et al., 1993</link><!--:PMID 15463660-->). The analogy is particularly attractive with <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis>, because of the similarity between the free-living life-cycle of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> and that of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. This analogy has been investigated. For <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis>, laser ablation of amphidial neurons has identified the two that are necessary to control the female developmental decision. These amphidial neurons were identified by analogy with <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib8">Ashton et al., 1995</link><!--: 7665730-->; <link linkend="bib9">Ashton et al., 1998</link><!--:PMID 9714195-->; <link linkend="bib7">Ashton and Schad, 1996</link><!--:PMID 15275212-->).</para>
<para>The central role of <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=daf-7;class=Gene" role="_blank">daf-7</ulink></emphasis> in controlling the dauer-formation decision of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib61">Ren et al., 1996</link><!--:PMID 8910282-->), has promoted investigation of putative homologous genes in parasitic nematodes, including <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis>. However, based on comparison of the life-cycle stage expression pattern, this has not supported the parasitic nematode infective L3 - free-living nematode dauer larvae analogy (<link linkend="bib17">Crook et al., 2005</link><!--:PMID 15664656-->; <link linkend="bib52">Massey et al., 2005</link><!--:PMID 15907565-->; <link linkend="bib81">Viney et al., 2005</link><!--:PMID 16139836-->).</para>

<title>Maintaining the life-cycle</title>
<para><emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> is surprisingly easy to maintain in the laboratory. To grow the free-living generation, faeces (collected from an infected laboratory animal) simply need to be maintained damp and at a slightly elevated temperature. For some host species (carnivores, primates, or anything with particularly smelly faeces) the faecal material should be mixed with wetted activated charcoal. There are many different ways in which the faeces can be cultured, with the &#x02018;sophistication&#x02019; of these different methods simply seeking to allow the larval and adult stages to separate themselves from faecal material. The methods for <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> are given in detail in <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_strongyloides/strongyloides.html" role="_blank"><emphasis>Strongyloides stercoralis</emphasis>: a model for translational research on parasitic nematode biology</ulink>. Larvae recovered from faecal cultures can also be maintained on modified NGM agar plates (<link linkend="bib23">Gardner et al., 2004</link><!--:PMID 15489049-->; <link linkend="bib45">Li et al., 2006</link><!--:PMID 16500658-->).</para>
<para>Infective L3s recovered from faecal cultures can be used to infect host animals. This can be done &#x02018;naturally&#x02019; by applying larvae to dampened skin or fur (<link linkend="bib72">Tindall and Wilson, 1988</link><!--:PMID 340564-->). More routinely, infective L3s can be inoculated subcutaneously by injection (e.g., <link linkend="bib83">Wilkes et al., 2004</link><!--:PMID 15206469-->). The eggs and larvae of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> passed in faeces are susceptible to desiccation. This has two consequences. Firstly, if infected hosts are maintained in dry conditions, then between-animal transmission within an animal house will not occur. Secondly, when collecting faeces with which to initiate faecal cultures, either freshly deposited faeces must be collected or cages must be arranged so that faeces collect onto a damp surface.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sec9">
<title>The parasitic phase of the life-cycle</title>
<para>The biology of the parasitic phase, principally the parasitic females, is the least well known, largely because of the relative difficulty of working with these stages. The females are embedded in the mucosa of the small intestine, often close to the crypts of Lieberk&#x000FC;hn (<link linkend="bib19">Dawkins et al., 1983</link><!--:PMID 688034-->). The females migrate through the mucosa, leaving trails of eggs (see <link linkend="figure2">Figure 2</link>; <link linkend="bib35">Grove et al., 1987</link><!--:PMID 3429117-->). These eggs then, presumably passively, make their way to the gut lumen, before being passed out of the host in faeces either before and, or shortly after hatching depending on the species. Parasitic females are usually concentrated in the proximal part of the small intestine.</para>
<para>Infected hosts make an anti-<emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> immune response against both larvae migrating from the site of infection to the intestine, and against intestinal parasitic females. The nature of this response differs between these sites and stages of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib12">Bell et al., 1981</link><!--:PMID 7318985-->; <link linkend="bib44">Korenaga et al., 1983</link><!--:PMID 6827449-->). The host immune response has deleterious effects on the parasitic females. Parasitic females become shorter, their fecundity is reduced and they become more posteriorly positioned in the host intestine as an anti-<emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> immune response develops (<link linkend="bib43">Kimura et al., 1999</link><!--:PMID 10466130-->; <link linkend="bib83">Wilkes et al., 2004</link><!--:PMID 15206469-->). These effects either do not occur in immunodeficient hosts (e.g., in nude rats which are athymic and, hence, have no T-cell arm of the immune system) or are reversible if the host is immunosuppressed (<link linkend="bib25">Gemmill et al., 1997</link>; <link linkend="bib82">Viney et al., 2006</link><!--:PMID 16817996-->). Ultimately these effects of the host immune response result in most experimental animals losing their infections after a period of time. For <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> in rats, readily detectable patent infections last for approximately a month, though some worms persist for up to about 10 weeks (<link linkend="bib43">Kimura et al., 1999</link>; <link linkend="bib83">Wilkes et al., 2004</link><!--:PMID 15206469-->). <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> infections of nude rats last for approximately a year (403 days), with the parasitic females dying of senescence (<link linkend="bib24">Gardner et al., 2006</link><!--:PMID 16913877-->). The maximum lifespan of <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> free-living females is five days (<link linkend="bib23">Gardner et al., 2004</link><!--PMID 15489049-->); thus, the two female forms of the <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> life-cycle have an 80-fold difference in their maximum lifespan (<link linkend="bib24">Gardner et al., 2006</link><!--:PMID 16913877-->).</para>
<para>For <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis>, host immunosuppression is used both to enhance the longevity and intensity of infection, and to facilitate experimental autoinfection (<link linkend="bib34">Grove et al., 1983</link><!--:PMID 6642862-->; see <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_strongyloides/strongyloides.html" role="_blank"><emphasis>Strongyloides stercoralis</emphasis>: a model for translational research on parasitic nematode biology</ulink>).</para>
<para><emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> infections can readily be treated with anthelminthic drugs both therapeutically and experimentally. The drug of choice is thiabendazole, though ivermectin is also effective, especially for disseminated infection (<link linkend="bib33">Grove, 1989b</link>; <link linkend="bib15">Conway et al., 1995</link>; <link linkend="bib74">Turner et al., 2005</link><!--:PMID 16282302-->).</para>

<title>Genomics</title>
<para>There have been expressed sequence tag (EST) analyses of <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> (free-living L1 and infective L3s) and <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> (free-living L1, L2, mixed free-living adults and infective L3s, parasitic females; <link linkend="bib54">Mitreva et al., 2004</link><!--:PMID 1476205-->; <link linkend="bib70">Thompson et al., 2005</link><!--:PMID 15907559-->).</para>
<para>For <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis>, <emphasis>c</emphasis>. 11,000 ESTs were obtained, which grouped into 3,311 clusters (the majority of which are likely to be single genes), of which 85% had significant BLAST alignments. Comparison of <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> L1- and infective L3-biased or -specific clusters with <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> nutrient-rich- or dauer-specific genes, showed significant matches between <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> L1 and <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> nutrient-rich-specific transcripts only; thus the conservation of the <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> infective L3 - <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> dauer transcriptional profiles was not supported by this analysis (<link linkend="bib54">Mitreva et al., 2004</link><!--:PMID 1476205-->).</para>
<para>For <emphasis>S. ratti, c.</emphasis> 15,000 ESTs were obtained, which grouped into 4,152 clusters, with these distributed equally between the free-living and parasitic cDNA libraries (<link linkend="bib70">Thompson et al., 2005</link><!--:PMID 15907559-->). 75% of these clusters had significant BLAST alignments; 25% had no significant alignment. This high level of non-alignment is a feature of nematode EST analyses, which probably reflects both the large evolutionary distance between taxa as well as the diversity of life histories (<link linkend="bib60">Parkinson et al., 2004</link><!--:PMID 15543149-->). There was substantial free-living and parasitic stage-specificity in detected ESTs (<link linkend="bib71">Thompson et al., 2006</link><!--:PMID 16784522-->). The <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> ESTs have been used to construct microarrays, which have been used for expression analysis of the free-living and parasitic stages (<link linkend="bib71">Thompson et al., 2006</link><!--:PMID 16784522-->). Overall, using <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> EST representation and microarray data, there was rather little evidence for the conservation of transcriptional profiles between <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> and <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> or <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib71">Thompson et al., 2006</link><!--:PMID 16784522-->).</para>
<para>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute is now in the process of sequencing the <emphasis>S. ratti</emphasis> genome (together with four other helminth species) as a reference genome, with subsequent whole genome shotgun sequencing of the <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> genome planned (<ulink url="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Helminths/" role="_blank">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Helminths/</ulink>). This gene discovery will facilitate research on these species. However, in view of the substantial diversity among the nematodes and the relative lack of tools for investigating gene function in parasitic species, a very substantial amount of work remains to be done.</para>
