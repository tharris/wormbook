<caption>     <formalpara>         <title>Figure 5. General model of vesicular transport pathways</title>	<para>Transport between organelles is mediated by vesicles. Vesicle formation at various steps is driven by specific coat protein complexes. The <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> genome contains genes encoding all of these coat proteins, although some of them have not been studied functionally.</para>     </formalpara></caption>
