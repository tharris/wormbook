<caption>     <formalpara>         <title>Figure 4. GFP endocytosis by coelomocytes</title>	<para>Signal sequence-tagged GFP is synthesized in muscle and secreted into the body cavity. Coelomocytes efficiently take up GFP from the body cavity and accumulate GFP in large vesicles. Fluorescent micrograph of wild-type and typical <emphasis>cup</emphasis> mutant worms expressing GFP are shown. High magnification image of a wild-type coelomocyte is also shown.</para>     </formalpara></caption>
