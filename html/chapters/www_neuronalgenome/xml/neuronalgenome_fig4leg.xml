<title><emphasis role="bold">Figure 4: Phylogenetic analysis of cysteine-loop ligand-gated ion channels.</emphasis></title>
<para>This phylogenetic tree was generated from the ligand-binding domains of 1426 putative LGIC genes. Genes were identified by a BLAST search using 210 seed sequences and then refined using Genewise. A thousand bootstrap iterations were performed and branches below 50% bootstrap support were collapsed. Nematode sequences are shown in shades of green, platyhelminthes in yellow, insects in purple and vertebrates in red. <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> subunit names are labeled in green.
