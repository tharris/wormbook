<title><emphasis role="bold">Figure 2: The superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels.</emphasis></title>
<para>This phylogenetic tree shows the diversity of the &lsquo;voltage-gated ion channel&rsquo; super-family in metazoan genomes. TRP channels and cyclic nucleotide gated channels are gated by internal ligands or sensory inputs rather than voltage. The ryanodine and IP3 receptors are not shown. Voltage-gated sodium channels and HCN channels are not found in the worm genome. The tree was generated from the minimal pore regions of 143 vertebrate and invertebrate members of the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily. See Figure 1 for overall topology of the voltage-gated superfamily members. For a list of the worm potassium channels, see Table 4. K<subscript>v</subscript>10-12 are the 6TM Eag-like subfamily, K<subscript><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=Ca;class=Cell" role="_blank">Ca</ulink></subscript> is the 6TM Slo and SK family, K<subscript>ir</subscript> is the 2TM family and K2P is the two-pore 4TM (TWIK) family. For the voltage-gated calcium channel family, see Table 4, for the TRP family, see Table 7 (TPC is a TRP subfamily with more transmembrane domains and 2 pores; the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> homolog is <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=lov-1;class=Gene" role="_blank">lov-1</ulink></emphasis>), for the CNG family, see Table 8.
