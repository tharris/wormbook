<title><emphasis role="bold">Figure 1: Topology of the main families of ion channels.</emphasis></title>
<para>Only the pore-forming subunits are shown. Note that the sodium and calcium channels are made from a repeating unit of the potassium channels. All of these ion channel families are found in worms; however, voltage-gated sodium channels and P2X channels are not encoded in the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> genome. The numbers next to the brackets indicate the number of subunits in multimeric channel structures. These are highly schematized drawings that reflect transmembrane topologies; variable sizes in the loop domains are not illustrated.</para>
