<para>Schematic examples of substrates for AS coupled to NMD. Only the alternatively spliced regions to the end of the transcribed region are shown. The splicing of the PTC-containing isoform is shown on top and the full length isoform splicing is shown at the bottom. Position of the PTC and the full-length termination codon (TC) are indicated. The length of the genomic region, from the beginning of the constitutive exon upstream of the alternative cassette exon to the end of the 3&#x2032; UTR, is indicated along with the class of NMD involved (strong, inefficient or regulated) (<link linkend="bib6">Barberan-Soler et al., 2009</link><!--PMID 19617316-->). Note that the features of these transcripts that determine which of the NMD classes the PTC-containing substrates will follow are currently unknown.</para>
