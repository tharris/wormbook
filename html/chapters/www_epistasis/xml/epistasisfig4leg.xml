        <title>Figure 4. Epistasis analysis</title>
	<para>The phenotypes of a set of genotypes and the inferences are shown. The inferred pathway leading to the outcome 1 (black oval; *) is shown at the top. The default outcome is 2. Phenotypes are described in two ways in this Figure:  as transformations from 1 to 2 or 2 to 1, or as missing and extra structures, states or parameters. The inference from the phenotype of each genotype is shown. For example, in (ii), the absence of A leads to no 1; thus A promotes *. However, in (iii), the absence of B leads to extra 1; thus B inhibits *.</para>
