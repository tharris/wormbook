        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Chemoperception is a central sense of soil nematodes like <emphasis>Caenorhabditis
            elegans</emphasis>, as it is for most other animals (reviewed in <link linkend="bib28">Mori, 1999</link><!--:
            PMID10690413-->; <link linkend="bib36">Sengupta, 1997</link><!--: PMID15001091-->; <link linkend="bib3">Bargmann, 1997</link><!--: PMID?-->). Following the
            Nobel-Prize-winning discovery of olfactory receptors (ORs) in mammals (<link linkend="bib6">Buck and Axel,
            1991</link><!--: PMID1840504-->) as members of the rhodopsin superfamily of G-protein-coupled
            receptors (GPCRs) with seven transmembrane domains (7TM), Troemel et al. identified a
            series of disparate GPCRs as candidate olfactory receptors in <emphasis>C.
            elegans</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib43">Troemel et al., 1995</link><!--: PMID7585938-->). These identifications were made
            from some of the earliest sequences reported by the genome project and proved to be the
            tip of the iceberg. The genes were classified into small gene families and given names
            starting with sr for serpentine receptor (<emphasis>sra</emphasis>,
            <emphasis>srb</emphasis>, <emphasis>srd</emphasis>, <emphasis>sre</emphasis>, and
            <emphasis>sro</emphasis>). Their probable chemosensory function was based on transgene
            expression patterns in one or more known pairs of chemosensory neurons. Subsequently,
            Sengupta et al. used a genetic screen to identify <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=odr-10" role="_blank">odr-10</ulink></emphasis>, which
            they showed encodes a GPCR that mediates olfactory response to diacetyl (<link linkend="bib37">Sengupta et
            al., 1996</link><!--: PMID8601313-->). With completion of the genome sequence it became possible to
            flesh out the true extent of these and related gene families encoding GPCRs that are
            candidate chemoreceptors. Robertson (<link linkend="bib31">Robertson, 1998</link><!--: PMID9582190-->; <link linkend="bib33">Robertson, 2001</link><!--:
            PMID11238245-->) worked up the relatives of <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=odr-10" role="_blank">odr-10</ulink></emphasis> as the large <emphasis>str</emphasis>
            family along with the related <emphasis>sri</emphasis> and <emphasis>srj</emphasis>
            families, and then also worked up the large related <emphasis>srh</emphasis> family (<link linkend="bib32">Robertson, 2000</link><!--:
            PMID 10673277-->). Annotation and naming of the smaller <emphasis>sra</emphasis> family was
            completed by HMR as part of the comparison with <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib38">Stein
            et al., 2003</link><!--: PMID14624247-->), while Chen et al. described the related
            <emphasis>srab</emphasis> family (<link linkend="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</link><!--: PMID15618405-->), and Thomas et al.
            described the <emphasis>srz</emphasis> family (<link linkend="bib42">Thomas et al., 2005</link><!--: PMID15761060-->) and
            the <emphasis>srt</emphasis> family (<link linkend="bib46">Thomas, 2006</link> [in press]). A decade after their first recognition, we describe here
            all the remaining families and relate them in a series of superfamilies that comprise a
            remarkable array of roughly 1300 potentially functional candidate chemoreceptor genes,
            along with about 400 apparent pseudogenes. Together they comprise roughly 7% of the gene
            complement of this tiny animal, more than any other sequenced genome. This large genetic
            investment might result from an extreme dependence on chemosensory abilities in the
            absence of visual and auditory systems. On the basis of genetic complexity, this system
            probably constitutes the bulk of signal transduction that occurs in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>.</para>
        <para>We first discuss these families below in superfamily groupings, loosely defined as
            consisting of readily recognizable groupings based on protein sequence similarity, as
            well as sometimes shared intron locations in their genes. We then discuss various
            aspects of their biology, including new expression pattern results that support their
            likely function as chemoreceptors. For the rest of this chapter, while fully
            acknowledging the formal status of all but <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=odr-10" role="_blank">odr-10</ulink></emphasis> as putative or
            candidate chemoreceptors, we will refer to them as chemoreceptors. Genetic analysis of
            sensory-neuron specific G proteins indicates that olfaction, nociception, and pheromone
            responses are mediated predominantly by GPCRs (e.g., <link linkend="bib16">Hilliard et al., 2004</link><!--: PMID14988722-->;
            <link linkend="bib17">Jansen et al., 1999</link><!--: PMID10192394-->; <link linkend="bib18">Jansen et al., 2002</link><!--: PMID11867526-->; <link linkend="bib30">Roayaie et al.,
            1998</link><!--: PMID9459442-->) and it is difficult to see what else these huge families might
            generally mediate. Nevertheless, it seems likely that some of the genes have been
            subsequently recruited to other roles such as monitoring of internal chemistry, so the
            function of any specific gene should be interpreted with caution.</para>

    <sect1>
        <title>Summary of the chemoreceptor families</title>
        <para><link linkend="table1">Table 1</link> lists the named chemoreceptor families by superfamily group with the numbers
            of apparently intact genes and of apparent pseudogenes in each. Annotation of the genes
            is not nearly as straightforward as for mammalian olfactory receptors, because the
                <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> genes have complex gene structures with 1&#x02013;8 introns
            each, and the intron locations are commonly different between gene families. EST data
            are of little assistance due to uniformly low expression levels (e.g., of ~160,000 ESTs
            on WS138, only 81 were from chemoreceptor genes). In the absence of functional
            information it is not possible to be confident of the functionality of any specific
            gene, but each has been annotated to encode a seemingly intact full-length protein that
            aligns well with other family members. It is always possible that particular amino acid
            changes or small in-frame insertions or deletions might inactivate an otherwise
            apparently intact receptor. On the other hand, amongst the apparent pseudogenes from N2
            is a subset with probable functional alleles in other wild strains of <emphasis>C.
            elegans</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib39">Stewart et al., 2005</link>). In part because of this we have
            chosen to name both genes and pseudogenes in these families. We have arbitrarily chosen
            to ignore gene fragments that encode less than 50% of the amino acid length typical for
            a gene family. The curated annotations and gene names for all families should be correct
            in WormBase release WS141, though ongoing studies will undoubtedly refine their structure.</para>

            <title>The Str superfamily</title>
            <para>The Str superfamily consists of the <emphasis>str</emphasis>,
                <emphasis>srd</emphasis>, <emphasis>srh</emphasis>, <emphasis>sri</emphasis>,
                <emphasis>srj</emphasis>, <emphasis>srm</emphasis>, and <emphasis>srn</emphasis>
                genes, with a total of 795 genes and pseudogenes. The superfamily includes the <emphasis>str</emphasis>
                and <emphasis>srh</emphasis> families, which are the two largest gene families in <emphasis>C.
                elegans</emphasis>. Robertson was able to extract considerable information about
                gene family, intron, and chromosomal evolution from studies of these large families
                (<link linkend="bib31">Robertson, 1998</link><!--: PMID9582190-->; <link linkend="bib32">Robertson, 2000</link><!--: PMID10673277-->; <link linkend="bib33">Robertson, 2001</link><!--:
                PMID11238245-->). Similar analysis has subsequently been extended to all of the other
                families. The high frequency of pseudogenes in these families was novel at the time
                for <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, but is now more commonly recognized in the
                genome (e.g., <link linkend="bib29">Mounsey et al., 2002</link><!--: PMID11997343-->). Rampant gain and loss of introns
                was inferred from phylogenetic analysis and has been confirmed by genome-wide and
                comparative analyses with <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> (e.g., <link linkend="bib10">Coghlan and Wolfe,
                2004</link><!--: PMID15243155-->; <link linkend="bib22">Kiontke et al., 2004</link><!--: PMID15184656-->). Processes of genome flux
                have moved these genes around a lot, although somewhat mysteriously retaining most
                of them on the large chromosome V, which might reflect functional clustering with
                each other and other chemoreceptor genes, similar to that inferred for several other
                gene classes (e.g., <link linkend="bib27">Miller et al., 2004</link><!--: PMID15268860-->). Comparisons across the entire
                superfamily show that the srd family is a highly divergent and basal family (<xref
                linkend="figure1"/>), with just one intron location ancestrally shared in the family

                (<link linkend="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</link><!--: PMID15618405-->) did not note any pseudogenes in the

            <title>The <emphasis>srw </emphasis>family</title>
            <para>The <emphasis>srw</emphasis> family of 145 genes and pseudogenes is unusual among
                the candidate chemoreceptors because its origins from another family of otherwise
                conserved GPCRs can be recognized. This family of highly divergent genes and many
                pseudogenes is related to families of apparent FMRFamide and other peptide
                receptors, which have relatives in vertebrates and insects (e.g., <link linkend="bib13">Egerod et al.,
                2003</link><!--: PMID12907701-->; <link linkend="bib25">Meeusen et al., 2002</link><!--: PMID12438685-->; <link linkend="bib26">Mertens et al., 2004</link><!--:
                PMID15327975-->; <xref linkend="figure2"/>). The candidate FMRFamide/peptide receptors
                are dispersed in the genome, but almost 90% of <emphasis>srw</emphasis> genes are on
                chromosome V, most in large clusters on the chromosomal arms (<xref
                linkend="figure3"/>B). Given the similarities of their gene family evolution to that
                of the other families, and their common genomic organization, we hypothesize that
                the <emphasis>srw</emphasis> family represents a novel origin of chemoreceptors within the nematode
                lineage, perhaps serving as environmental peptide receptors.</para>

        <title>Gene expansions</title>
        <para>An unusual characteristic of the chemoreceptor families is their highly dynamic gene
            number, reflected within <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> by frequent duplications and
            gene loss. Systematic comparisons with <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> are only
            beginning, but evidence thus far indicates that the familiar concept of orthology is
            largely useless for these families due to their dynamic evolution. <xref
            linkend="figure4"/> shows a phylogenetic tree of two of the three families for which a
            completed <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> annotation is available (<link linkend="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</link><!--:
            PMID15618405-->). Several large expansions in gene number in <emphasis>C.
            elegans</emphasis> are apparent and only 7 pairs of genes are convincing one-to-one
            orthologs. Several additional reciprocal best match pairs (marked "a") are substantially
            more divergent in protein sequence, which probably indicates that they duplicated well
            before <emphasis>elegans-briggsae</emphasis> speciation (followed by loss of one copy in
            both species) and are not orthologs in the strict sense. Similar dynamics are even more
            extreme in the <emphasis>srz</emphasis> family (<link linkend="bib42">Thomas et al., 2005</link><!--: PMID15761060-->) and
            the <emphasis>srh</emphasis> families (JHT, unpublished).</para>

        <para>Much work remains to be completed, but the broad picture is that the chemoreceptor
            gene families are in a dynamic state, with fixation of new gene duplicates approximately
            balancing gene loss (reflected in the large number of defective genes, and in the
            evidence for ultimate deletion of many genes entirely). Over relatively short periods
            this dynamic is probably near equilibrium, resulting in a stable number of genes.
            However, over longer periods unknown factors can change the relative rates of gene gain
            and gene loss, giving rise to the dramatically different gene numbers in <emphasis>C.
            elegans</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis>. This pattern is strikingly
            reminiscent of recent findings in mammalian odorant and vomeronasal gene families, in
            which gene duplications, gene loss, and lineage specific expansions are common (<link linkend="bib12">Del
            Punta et al., 2000</link><!--: PMID11116090-->; <link linkend="bib14">Glusman et al., 2001</link><!--: PMID11337468-->; <link linkend="bib23">Matsunami et al.,
            2000</link><!--: PMID10766242-->). It will be interesting to determine the chemosensory gene
            distributions for the other <emphasis>Caenorhabditis</emphasis> species currently in the
            genome sequencing pipeline.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
        <title>Gene clusters</title>
        <para>The putative chemosensory genes are strongly clustered in the genome (<xref
            linkend="figure3"/>). Most families are heavily enriched on chromosome V, and
            significant enrichment is also found on chromosomes II and IV. Furthermore, the
            positions of genes on all of these chromosomes are strongly biased toward the chromosome
            arms (as defined by increased recombination frequency; <link linkend="bib5">Barnes et al., 1995</link><!--:
            PMID8536965-->). In addition to these broad patterns of gene clustering, there is a strong
            tendency for closely related genes to be physically close in the genome (<link linkend="bib7">Chen et al.,
            2005</link><!--: PMID15618405-->; <link linkend="bib32">Robertson, 2000</link><!--: PMID10673277-->; <link linkend="bib31">Robertson, 2001</link><!--: PMID11238245-->). These
            patterns are likely attributable to patterns of gene duplication in <emphasis>C.
            elegans</emphasis>. New duplications are almost always local, often tandem or inverted
            repeats with little or no intervening sequence between the duplicates (<link linkend="bib20">Katju and Lynch, 2003</link><!--:
            PMID14704166-->; <link linkend="bib35">Semple and Wolfe, 1999</link><!--: PMID10198121-->). The current gene positions are
            consistent with a history of frequent local gene duplication and rare large chromosomal
            rearrangements, which occasionally break up clusters of local related genes. These large
            rearrangements are rarely if ever interchromosomal translocations; we suspect that most
            are inversions.</para>
        <para>Detailed analysis of the distribution of <emphasis>srh</emphasis> and <emphasis>str</emphasis> genes not on chromosome V showed
            that small interchromosomal transposition events occur occasionally (<link linkend="bib31">Robertson, 1998</link><!--:
            PMID9582190-->; <link linkend="bib32">Robertson, 2000</link><!--: PMID10673277-->; <link linkend="bib33">Robertson, 2001</link><!--: PMID11238245-->). These events
            are followed in some cases by a duplication and diversification process in the new
            genomic location. As with chromosome V, residence on other chromosomal arms seems to
            favor the duplication process. The mechanisms underlying this pattern are not known, but
            are likely to involve the higher frequency of complex DNA repeats found on almost every
            autosomal arm.</para>

    <sect1>
        <title>Function and expression patterns</title>
        <para>Analysis of the function of <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> chemoreceptors has been
            remarkably resistant to genetic methods. Only <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=odr-10" role="_blank">odr-10</ulink></emphasis> has been
            identified in classical forward genetic screens (<link linkend="bib37">Sengupta et al., 1996</link><!--: PMID8601313-->) and
            the fraction of genes assigned gross phenotypes in the initial global RNAi screen is
            close to zero (<link linkend="bib19">Kamath et al., 2003</link><!--: PMID12529635-->). This resistance may result from a
            combination of the expected narrow phenotype range for the genes (and a relative paucity
            of genetic screens directed toward this) and genetic redundancy among closely related
            receptors. A few additional chemoreceptor genes have more limited phenotypic
            information. Deletion or overexpression of <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=sra-13" role="_blank">sra-13</ulink> </emphasis>affects olfactory
            response to isoamyl alcohol and also affects vulval induction, probably as part of a
            sensory response to starvation (<link linkend="bib5">Battu et al., 2003</link><!--: PMID12736202-->). One sign of hope is
            that about 25 chemoreceptor genes were identified as affecting fat accumulation in a
            global RNAi screen testing specifically for this phenotype (<link linkend="bib2">Ashrafi et al., 2003</link><!--:
            PMID12529643-->). In addition, RNAi knockdown of <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=str-2" role="_blank">str-2</ulink></emphasis> is reported to
            extend lifespan, though the effect is small (<link linkend="bib1">Alcedo and Kenyon, 2004</link><!--: PMID14715134-->).
            These RNAi results are uncorroborated by other approaches, but it is possible that
            environmental chemoperception or internal physiological monitoring by chemoreceptors
            plays a prominent role in energy resource allocation.</para>
        <para>The cellular expression patterns of the putative chemosensory receptor genes are of
            interest for two reasons. First, their classification as chemosensory receptors is
            currently best assessed by testing whether expression is predominantly in chemosensory
            neurons. Second, because of the large set of genes, their patterns of expression provide
            a remarkable opportunity to study the relationship between cell fate, transcription
            factors, and <emphasis>cis</emphasis> regulatory sequences. Only one gene in the entire
            SR class has been rigorously shown to function as a chemosensory receptor (<link linkend="bib37">Sengupta et
            al., 1996</link><!--: PMID8601313-->; <link linkend="bib45">Zhang et al., 1997</link><!--: PMID9342380-->). Are the other ~1,300 genes
            really chemosensory receptors, or are they a mixture of chemoreceptors and other types
            of receptors? Transgenic GFP-fusion expression data bearing on this question are
            summarized in <link linkend="table2">Table 2</link>. Though the coverage of the superfamily is insufficient to draw
            detailed inferences, a broad picture can be painted. Many genes are expressed only in
            chemosensory neurons, consistent with a strictly chemosensory function. There are also exceptions to this rule, which might result from real function in other types
            of neurons and non-neuronal tissue or from transgenic misexpression in ectopic tissues,
            possibilities that it is currently not possible to distinguish. In addition to GFP
            fusion data, one study used microarrays to examine gene expression from cell-sorted AWB
            neurons (<link linkend="bib11">Colosimo et al., 2004</link><!--: PMID15620651-->), a method that is likely to gain
            importance in the future. SR genes were prominent among the genes identified, including
                <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=str-220" role="_blank">str-220</ulink></emphasis>, <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=srd-16" role="_blank">srd-16</ulink></emphasis>,
            <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=srd-23" role="_blank">srd-23</ulink></emphasis>, <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=sru-38" role="_blank">sru-38</ulink></emphasis>, and
            <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=srsx-5" role="_blank">srsx-5</ulink></emphasis>. Analysis of SR expression by microarray studies using total
            worm mRNA is problematic because of their generally low abundance transcript levels;
            though some genes were assigned to expression mountains (<link linkend="bib21">Kim et al., 2001</link><!--:
            PMID11557892-->), these assignments should be viewed with some skepticism because absolute
            expression levels are typically at or close to noise levels.</para>
        <para>A final method that shows promise in assigning expression patterns to SR genes is
            identification and analysis of specific promoter sequence motifs that may be binding
            sites for transcription factors. Using this approach, one study identified a
            well-defined E-box motif in the promoters of about 200 SR genes, mostly from the <emphasis>srh</emphasis> and
            <emphasis>sri</emphasis> families (<link linkend="bib24">McCarroll et al., 2005</link>). It was further
            shown that the E-box is correlated with expression in the ADL chemosensory neuron, and
            that it was sufficient to direct expression of <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=odr-10" role="_blank">odr-10</ulink></emphasis> in ADL.</para>
