        <para>Unrooted neighbor-joining tree of all putative functional SRA and SRAB proteins from <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> (blue) and <emphasis>C. briggsae</emphasis> (red). Data are adapted from <link linkend="bib7">Chen et al. (2005)</link><!--: PMID15618405-->. Arrows point to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> gene expansions. "orth" <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x003D;</symbol> putative one-to-one orthologs. "a" <symbol role="symbolfont">&#x003D;</symbol> possible paralogs with reciprocal gene loss. The distinction between orthologs and paralogs is based only on protein distance and is somewhat arbitrary, though in approximate agreement with the average divergence of apparent orthologs in other chemoreceptor families.</para>
