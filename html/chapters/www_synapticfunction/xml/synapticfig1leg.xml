        <para>Synaptic vesicles contain neurotransmitter transporters that load vesicles with
            neurotransmitter. Mobilized vesicles translocate to the terminal plasma membrane where
            they selectively dock close to the active zone. Docked vesicles then undergo a priming
            step, during which vesicles become fusion competent. A rise in intracellular calcium
            binds to calcium sensors triggering vesicle fusion and release of neurotransmitter into
            the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitter can then bind and activate receptors. Following
            full-fusion, vesicle proteins and membrane are retrieved by clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</para>
