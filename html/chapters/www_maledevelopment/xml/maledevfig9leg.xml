        <title>Figure 9. Lineage-specific expression of Hox genes establishes the identities of the
            V5 and V6 rays</title>
        <para>(A) The postembryonic cell lineages that give rise to the rays. Cell fates in these
            lineages are fixed once the blast cells V5, V6, and T begin to divide. (B) MAB-5 is
            expressed in an ON/OFF pattern in the V5 lineage (Salser and Kenyon, 1996<!-- ; PMID
            8625851 -->). Expression must be OFF in V5.p to allow formation of the postdeirid. It must
            be ON in V5.ppp to induce the equational division of this cell and then OFF again to
            prevent expression of a ray by the V5.pppa branch. Finally it must be ON in V5.ppppp to
            generate a ray but go OFF in the sublineage to allow expression of the ray 1 identity.
            In V6, MAB-5 expression begins during embryogenesis and remains ON throughout
            postembryonic development except in the ray 3, 5, and 6 branches. (C) EGL-5 expression
            begins in V6.ppp and in the ray 3 branch (Ferreira et al., 1999<!-- ; PMID 10049576 -->).</para>
