        <para>The male tail retracts during the last 4 hours of the L4 larval stage (Nomarski
            photomicrographs). (A) The tail just before retraction begins. (B) The tail tip hypodermal
            cells, hyp 9 and 10, are the first cells to retract. The arrow indicates the growing
            fluid-filled cavity between the future adult surface and the L4 cuticle. (C) and (D); the
            body retracts inside the L4 cuticle, the rays and fan extend. (E) and (F); lateral and
            ventral views of the adult male tail. In the animal shown in (F); the rays 8 and 9 are fused,
            as often happens. Reprinted from <emphasis>Developmental Biology</emphasis>, Nguyen et al., 1999, Copyright (1999), with permission from Elsevier.</para>
