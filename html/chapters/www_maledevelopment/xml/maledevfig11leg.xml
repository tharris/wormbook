        <title>Figure 11. Patterning of cell fates in the B lineage</title>
        <para>Left panels: Successive stages in the division of the B lineage, starting in the L1
            larval stage. Arrows indicate the position of the cross section. In D, the B.a progeny
            cells have formed a ring around the rectal canal. In E, one cell has moved in front of
            another. At this stage, cell signaling specifies which cell will take the anterior fate
            and which the posterior fate (see text and <xref linkend="figure12"/>). Right panels: Nomarski
            photomicrographs showing the positions of cell nuclei around the rectal canal.
