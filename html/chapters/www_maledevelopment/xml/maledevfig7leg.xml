        <title>Figure 7. The ray sublineage</title>
        <para>(A) The three cells of each ray (RnA: A-type sensory neuron; RnB: B-type sensory
            neuron; Rnst: ray structural cell) are descended from a single ray precursor cell (Rn).
            hyp: the Rn.p hypodermal cell. Ã—: programmed cell death. (B) The row of Rn cells in the
            L3 seam before they express the ray sublineage (Nomarski photomicrograph). Already by
            this stage the fates of the Rn cells are established so that each generates specifically
            one of the nine rays. The open triangle points to the positioning of the cloaca; the arrow indicates a landmark, the hypodermal cell V6.a.</para>
