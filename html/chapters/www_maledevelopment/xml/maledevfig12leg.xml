        <title>Figure 12. Multiple sets of interacting signals specify fates in the B lineage</title>
        <para>(A) Positions of the cells at mid-L3 larval stage. Signals from F and U specify the
            fates of the anterior ring of cells. (B) Illustration of the multiple signals that
            specify the B<symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x03B3;</symbol> fate, which is assumed by B.alpp or B.arpp, depending on which of these
            two cells assumes the more anterior position. The primary signal is from F and U (1).
            Additional positional cues are provided by other B.a progeny (2) and Y.p (3). Lateral
            inhibitory cues reinforce the <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x03B3;</symbol> and <symbol role= "symbolfont">&#x03B4;</symbol> decisions (4). Finally, cues from B.a progeny,
            which may be passive, prevent the F/U signal from acting inappropriately (5). Reprinted with permission from Chamberlin and Sternberg, 1993<!-- ; PMID 8223264 -->, Company of Biologists Ltd.</para>
