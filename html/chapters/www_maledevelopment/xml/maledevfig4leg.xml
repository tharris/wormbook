        <para>The locations of the blast cells in the posterior of an L1 larval male are shown (top: sagittal view; bottom: lateral view). Ventral neuroectoblasts P10 and P11 give rise to the hook and hook sensillum; rectal epithelial cells B and Y give rise respectively to the internal spicules and the post-cloacal sensilla; lateral seam cells V5, V6 and T each give rise to a subset of the rays.</para>
