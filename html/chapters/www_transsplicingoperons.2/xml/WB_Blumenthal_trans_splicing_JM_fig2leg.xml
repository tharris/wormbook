<title>Figure 2. Two types of operons in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis></title>
<para>Almost all <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> operons are of the SL2-type, shown on top. The site of 3&#x2019; end cleavage and polyadenylation of the upstream gene is determined by the AAUAAA signal, indicated by the black bar. The Ur element serves to protect the downstream RNA from degradation following 3&#x2019; end cleavage, as well as to attract the SL2 snRNP. Most operons of this type have about 100 bp between the cleavage and polyadenylation site of the upstream gene and the trans-splice site to which SL2 is spliced. A few <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> operons are of the SL1-type, shown on the bottom, where the site at which 3&#x2019; cleavage and polyadenylation occurs is also the trans-splice site for the downstream gene, so the intercistronic distance is effectively zero. These operons are always trans-spliced by the SL1 snRNP.</para>
