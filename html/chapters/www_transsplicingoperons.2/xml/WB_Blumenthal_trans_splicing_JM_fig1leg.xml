<title>Figure 1. Comparison of cis- and trans-splicing</title>
<para>In cis-splicing, the U1 snRNP base pairs with the 5&#x2019; splice site, and U2 snRNP base pairs with the branchpoint near the 3&#x2019; splice site. The intron is excised and the two exons are spliced together. In trans-splicing there is no 5&#x2019; splice site on the pre-mRNA for U1 snRNP binding. Instead, the 5&#x2019; splice site is provided by the donor SL snRNP, which may base pair with a sequence in the outron, the region of the pre-mRNA between the 5&#x2019; cap and the trans-splice site. The SL exon is then spliced to the first exon on the pre-mRNA. CBC: nuclear cap binding complex.</para>
