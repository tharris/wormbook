        <para>The hermaphrodites and males differ strikingly in overall body size and structures
            such as the somatic gonad and tail. Many other tissues and organs are sexually
            dimorphic, notably the nervous system and musculature. More detailed description of
            sex-specific cells and structures can be found elsewhere in the Sex determination section.</para>
