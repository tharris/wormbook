        <para>Feminizing factors are shown in red and masculinizing factors in blue. Arrows
            represent positive regulatory interactions and bars represent negative interactions. As
            described in the text, additional minor regulatory interactions (not shown) may
            fine-tune the pathway. For more information on these genes see <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/" role="_blank">Wormbase</ulink>.</para>
