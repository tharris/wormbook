<title>Figure 1. Life cycles of animal parasitic nematodes generally and of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> spp. and related parasites compared.</title>
<para><emphasis role="bold">A</emphasis> Generalized parasitic nematode life cycle featuring invariant pattern of development of pre-infective to infective larvae outside the host and development to reproductive adults and their progeny in the host. Status of the L3 as the infective stage is common to vertebrate animal parasites in nematode clades III, IV and V. Animal parasites in Clade I, principally <emphasis>Trichinella</emphasis> and <emphasis>Trichuris,</emphasis> infect the host as L1. <emphasis role="bold">B.</emphasis> Life cycle of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> and related genera featuring one or more generations of free-living development. The free-living female constitutes an advantageous target for gene transfer by gonadal microinjection.</para>
