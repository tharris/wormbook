<title>Figure 3. Large rodent cage modified for overnight collection of feces from rats or gerbils infected with <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> spp.</title>
<para>The unit consists of a standard laboratory rat cage outfitted with water bottle and food pellets. For overnight fecal collection, standard bedding is replaced with a raised wire floor (Ancare, Bellmore, NY USA, product code N10SSRWF) underlain by a layer of cardboard saturated with deionized water. The latter maintains fecal pellets in a fully hydrated state during the overnight collection so that parasites do not succumb to desiccation.</para>
