<title>Figure 2. Life cycle of <emphasis>Brugia</emphasis> spp.</title>
<para>Filariae such as <emphasis>Brugia</emphasis> spp. live as adults in the blood or lymphatic circulation, the connective tissues or tissue spaces. They release microfilariae (mf) into surrounding tissues where they are ingested by hematophagous arthropod vectors (mosquitoes in the case of <emphasis>Brugia</emphasis> spp.) in the process of blood feeding. Because they are obligate parasites, propagation of stable transgenic lines of filariae will require passage through both hosts and vectors. Embryos within the uteri of female worms explanted from laboratory animal hosts (gerbils) constitute practical targets for biolistic transfer of DNA constructs. Co-injection of infective L3 from mosquitoes with DNA constructs in the presence of high <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=Ca;class=Cell" role="_blank">Ca</ulink><superscript>++</superscript> into the peritoneal cavities of gerbils has resulted in heritable transformation of <emphasis>Brugia malayi</emphasis>.</para>
