<title>Figure 1. Midpoint rooted minimum evolution trees reconstructed from all known encapsulated (red) and nonencapsulated (green) species and genotypes of <emphasis>Trichinella</emphasis> based on the variation in mitochondrial LSU and COI DNA (on the left) and SSU rDNA (on the right)</title>
<para>Topological support is indicated by Bayesian posterior probabilities and by ML, minimum evolution (using ML distances), and parsimony bootstrap replicate analyses (B/ML/ME/P). Bootstrap support was reconstructed from 100-bp replicates.
