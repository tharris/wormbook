<title>Figure 4. Comprehensive summary of the main clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, and diagnostic test results for patients suffering from mild (light color) to severe (most intense color) clinical trichinellosis.</title>
<para>Labels on the left indicate qualitative aspects of the infection, while those on the right give a quantitative assessment of each. The colors are matched to the stage of the infection (shown at the bottom). When the color is faded in and out, that particular qualitative aspect is gradual in onset. The shaded portion (vertical shading between weeks 3 and 6) correlates with the period of infection in which the death of the patient usually occurs if the dose of parasite ingested is high enough to be lethal. Ab, antibody; Ag, antigen. Reprinted with permission from <link linkend="bib16">Cap&#x000F3; and Despommier (1996)</link>.</para>
