<h2>WormBook contributor information</h2>
<p>WormBook publishes concise reviews on topics related to the biology of <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> (<em>C. elegans</em>) and relevant experimental methods (WormMethods).</p> <p> The vast majority of WormBook chapters are commissioned by the Editorial
Board, and unsolicited manuscripts are not currently considered for review
or inclusion.  Nonetheless, WormBook welcomes suggestions for new review
topics, which can be submitted through the Feedback link and should include
(if possible) potential authors.  These suggestions will be considered by
the appropriate editors on the Board.</p>

<h3>Manuscript preparation</h3>
<p>Most WormBook contributions will be read online.  Long prose pieces are difficult to read, so we encourage you to structure your chapter with several sections and subsections, as appropriate. Try to be succinct. An outline of your section (the titles of the, subsections, etc.) will be visible on the screen as people read your text.</p>

<p>We would like your chapter to be between 2500 and 5000 words. Your text should be prepared as a Microsoft Word document. Include a short abstract, as well as a title page that contains the chapter name, author's names and affiliations, corresponding author information, name of the editorial board member overseeing your section, and date submitted. Please note in the text where the figures should be placed. Include acknowledgments, such as funding information, at the end of your text and use CGC approved gene names. When your contribution is published, it can contain links to other chapters in WormBook and will have links to data within WormBase. Indicate in the text the location of links to other WormBook chapters by including the exact chapter title and doi located in the citation information for each chapter.  For example (see Vulval development, http://<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.6.1">dx.doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.6.1</a>).  WormBook capitalizes only the first word of a title, for example, <em>The germ line</em>, rather than <em>The Germ Line</em> and genus names should be italicized when they appear on their own, as well as when included with the name of the species (<em>Drosophila</em>, as well as <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>).</p>

<h4>References</h4>

<p>Please format in-text references to include the PMID/accession number, for example:</p>

<p>(Doe et al., 2002: PMID12345678). Including the PMID number helps us generate links to the source. You should only reference articles that are published or in press. Cite unpublished findings, abstracts, submitted manuscripts etc. in the text only. Use "et al." only after 10 authors have been named. Format examples follow:</p>

<p>Article in a periodical: Sondheimer, N., and Lindquist, S. (2000). Rnq1: an epigenetic modifier of protein function in yeast. Mol. Cell, 163-172.</p>
<p>Article in a book: Sorenson, P.W., and Caprio, J.C. (1998). Chemoreception. In The Physiology of Fishes, D.H. Evans, ed. (Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press), pp. 375-405.</p>
<p>An entire book: Cowan, W.M., Jessell, T.M., and Zipursky, S.L. (1997). Molecular and Cellular Approaches to Neural Development (New York: Oxford University Press).</p>

<p>If you are using Endnote to format your references, you can use a template that can be downloaded <a href="WormBooktemplate.sit">here</a>. This file should be placed in your Styles folder. If you prefer not to use the template, then you can use the Cell style for the complete reference and modify the in-text citations to include the accession/PMID number.</p>

<h4>Figures</h4> <p>You may include as many figures as you feel are necessary. Figures should include a scale bar if appropriate. Units should be metric and follow SI convention. Please submit titled figure legends and limit the legends to no longer than 200 words. Submit line art at a resolution of 600dpi and gray-scale/color images at a minimum of 300dpi, at least 1800 pixels across, 6 inches wide. The preferred file format for line art is PNG. TIFF or Adobe Photoshop files are preferred for gray-scale/color images. We can also accept EPS (preferred format for vector files), JPEG, or Adobe Illustrator formats. For text within a figure, please use a <em>sans serif</em> font  such as Helvetica. Please do not send figures as PowerPoint, Canvas or Microsoft Word files. If a figure has previously been published elsewhere, then please obtain written permission from the publisher for its use and note in the figure legend, as specified by the publisher, that permission has been granted.</p>

<h4>Movies</h4>
<p>Submit movies as Quicktime files. Please limit file size to under 5 MB and include a titled legend.</p>

<h4>Tables</h4>
<p>Please submit tables as Microsoft Word files. Large tables should be included as appendices.</p>


<h3>Submission and review</h3>
<p>Submit your text and figures to the editor, Jane Mendel (<a href="mailto:mendelj@caltech.edu">mendelj@caltech.edu</a>). Please include with your submission an acknowledgment of your agreement to an open-access license (see Copyright section below), copies of any permissions you might have requested, as well as a PDF version of your chapter.</p>

<p>You may also place files on WormBook's FTP site. Contact Jane Mendel for access information.</p>

<p>Your contribution will be sent to two reviewers knowledgeable in the area covered by your chapter. You will have a chance to revise your manuscript based on the reviewer's comments.</p>

<h4>Proofs</h4>
<p>Prior to publication, you will receive proofs of your chapter.</p>

<h4>Updating your chapter</h4>
<p>Each chapter in WormBook will include the date it was last revised. Obviously, the more up-to-date a chapter is, the more use it will be to the community. In general, the editorial board will review chapters and decide when a major revision may be in order (after several years). You will, however, be allowed to update your chapter whenever you feel the need. Earlier versions of chapters are archived and available to readers.</p>
