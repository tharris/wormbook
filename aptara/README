UPDATE: 07 July 2014

Although the code for marking up docbook.xml chapters has changed *significantly* 
these changes should have very little impact on the process of marking up chapters.

This document describes these changes, how this portion of the markup pipeline works
and who the responsible parties are.

Overview:

WormBook staff will periodically -- in accordance with WormBase releases --
generate updated lists of entity-to-URI mappings. These are stored in directories
corresponding to the current WormBase version: WS239, WS240, etc.

Once generated, these files can be used by Aptara to generate entity-to-URI mappings
in docbook.xml chapters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Generating entity=URI key/value pairs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Responsible party : The WormBook group.
   Update frequency  : approximately once every two months.

   Usage :
       ./generate_object_to_uri_mappings_from_wormbase.pl

   Description :

	1. Creates directories 
  	       ace_dumps -- a temporary directory
	       WSXXX     -- output directory for object-to-uri mappings for 
 	                    current version of WormBase.
	2. Dumps lists of objects from WormBase to ace_dumps/
	3. Iterates over lists in ace_dumps, creating one file per class of
	   object-to-uri mappings, placing them in WSXXX/, eg:
	            
		WS239/Variation.txt

	4. gzips the output files in WSXXX/
        5. Updates a sylink:
        
	      current -> WSXXX	  
   
   Caveats :
	This script can ONLY be run on a server hosting the full WormBase
	database! It expects the server to answer on port 2005.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Marking up biological entities in docbook.xml with links to WormBase
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Responsible party : Aptara
   Update frequency  : on an as-needed basis

   Usage :

        ./markup_docbook_xml.pl

   Description :
        
	1. Creates a directory called xml_out/
	2. Reads object-to-uri mappings in current/
	3. Reads all .xml files in xml_in/
	4. Extracts sentences in each xml file
	5. Replaces known entities with appropriate URI from mappings
	6. Prints new xml to xml_out/[DATE]-[FILENAME]/[FILENAME].xml
              * there may be multiple files, including figure legends and references
	7. Once processed, files in xml_in are moved to 
             xml_out/[DATE]-[FILENAME]/original_docbook/[FILENAME]
        8. A log file is created in xml_out/[FILENAME]_text.log
           showing the number of entities marked up. Useful for debugging.
	
NOTES:

The markup_docbook_xml.pl script expects a 
naming convention like:

   WB_Kutscher_ShahamJM_text(.*).xml  

      Minimally, the  "_text(.*).xml" should be present. Anything 
      that proceeds it will become the output filename.

Sample output in xml_out/

    xml_out/YYYY-MM-DD-WB_Kutscher_ShahamJM/

        WB_Kutscher_ShahamJM_text.xml
		-- docbook xml with entities linked

	WB_Kutscher_ShahamJM_text.log
		-- report on number of entities linked
	
	original_docbook/
		-- directory containing the original docbook
		   xml files provided in xml_in.     





-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Testing the markup pipeline
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A sample docbook chapter is provided in t/sample_chapter/xml_docbook. To test the
pipeline, you need to relocate this sample to the xml_in directory.

 $ cp t/sample_chapter/xml_docbook/* xml_in/.

 // Now run the pipeline!
 // Using this command with no arguments will use:
 //     link definitions: in current/
 //     and markup docbook xml in: xml_in/
 // Output will be placed in xml_out/ in a directory corresponding to the 
 // name of the chapter.
 $ markup_docbook_xml.pl
