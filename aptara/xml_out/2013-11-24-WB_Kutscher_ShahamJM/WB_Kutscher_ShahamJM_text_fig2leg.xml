<title>Figure 2. An insertional mutagenesis screen for isolating genes disrupted by a transposon.</title>
<para>In insertional mutagenesis, transposons (Tc1, and more commonly <emphasis>Mos1</emphasis>) are mobilized in an appropriate strain background (<ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0001222;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">mutator</ulink> background or strain expressing <emphasis>Mos1</emphasis>-transposase). The transposon (orange) inserts randomly throughout the genome, via the transposase (gray), typically at a TA dinucleotide. DNA is isolated from animals that exhibit the phenotype of interest. Using inverse PCR, the DNA is cut with a restriction enzyme (RE) that is abundant throughout the genome and self-ligated. PCR is performed using two primers (A and <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=B;class=Cell" role="_blank">B</ulink>) within the transposon, elongating in opposite directions. PCR products (final panel) are size selected and sequenced to determine the position of insertion.</para>
