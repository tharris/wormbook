<title>Figure 5. Targeted gene deletions using transposons.</title>
<para>To generate a targeted gene deletion, a transposase and a rescuing transgene containing a selection marker (in this case, <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006843;class=Gene" role="_blank">unc-119</ulink></emphasis>) is injected into an <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006843;class=Gene" role="_blank">unc-119</ulink></emphasis> mutant animal carrying a transposon insertion near or in a gene of interest. Typically, strains carrying a single <emphasis>Mos1</emphasis> insertion near a gene of interest are obtained from the <emphasis role="underline">NemaGENETAG Consortium</emphasis> (<link linkend="bib9">Bazopoulou and Tavernarakis 2009</link><!--: PMID 19343510-->; <link linkend="bib116">Vallin et al., 2012</link><!--: PMID 22347378-->). Homology-directed repair after a double-strand break (DSB) occurs off the introduced transgene at low frequencies. <emphasis>unc-119(+)</emphasis> is inserted into the genome, and in the case of MosDEL, some portion of the gene is deleted, typically the 5&rsquo; region of the gene. In MosTIC, the transgene contains a <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBPhenotype:0000229;class=Phenotype" role="_blank">small</ulink> insertion, deletion, or point mutation, which is incorporated into the genomic DNA.</para>
