<title>Figure 3. Poison primer method for detecting deletions.</title>
<para>This technique enriches rare, deleted DNA over the more abundant, full-length, wild-type product. Primers a, b, and p are used in the first PCR to generate a wild-type template, a mutant template, and a &lsquo;poison&rsquo; template. In the second PCR, these products are used as template with primers a&rsquo; and b&rsquo; to increase the signal of the deleted product. Without the poison primer, full-length product dominates the PCR reaction, and the deletion product is below the detection limit. When the poison primer is included, total full-length amplification is decreased, and the deletion product is revealed.</para>
