<para>A. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) consist of three tandem Zinc finger domains (colored umbrellas) fused to a <emphasis>Fok</emphasis>I nuclease (gray). <emphasis>Fok</emphasis>I acts as a dimer, and specifically cleaves genomic DNA when two ZFNs are targeted in tandem. B. TALENs are similar to ZFNs, except that a single domain recognizes a single nucleotide, so one of four domains is fused together according to the genomic sequence. The nuclease is traditionally <emphasis>Fok</emphasis>I (gray), functioning as a dimer, although monomeric TALENs using I-TevI have recently been reported (<link linkend="bib12">Beurdeley et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23612303-->). C. The CRISPR system uses a single guide RNA (red) to target a region of interest for cleavage. The Cas9 nuclease (green) recognizes aspects of the secondary structure of the single guide RNA and the RNA:DNA hybrid. Cas9 also requires a protospacer motif, NGG, to cleave the DNA.</para>
