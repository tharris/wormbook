<title>Introduction</title>
<para>Mutations are the engine of natural selection and arise spontaneously through a myriad of mechanisms (<link linkend="bib91">Nei 2007</link><!--: PMID 17640887-->). In <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, spontaneous point mutations, gene duplications, and deletions arise at rates of 2 &times; 10<superscript>&minus;8</superscript>, 3.4 &times; 10<superscript>&minus;7</superscript>, and 2.2 &times; 10<superscript>&minus;7</superscript> per gene per generation, respectively (<link linkend="bib31">Denver et al., 2004</link><!--: PMID 15295601-->; <link linkend="bib72">Lipinski et al., 2011</link><!--: PMID 21295484-->). These alterations to the genome result from replication and repair errors, endogenous oxidative damage, and exogenous environmental insults (<link linkend="bib30">Denver et al., 2009</link><!--: PMID 19805298-->). Cosmic rays bombard the atmosphere of the Earth at a rate of approximately 2x10<superscript>18</superscript> particles per second (<link linkend="bib96">Reedy et al., 1983</link><!--: PMID 17841664-->), and they can also contribute to mutational load (<link linkend="bib4">Babcock and Collins 1929</link><!--: PMID 16587504-->). <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> has been used to study the effects of cosmic rays aboard the International Space Station (<link linkend="bib128">Zhao et al., 2006</link><!--: PMID 16765996-->). Despite exposure to an average radiation dose of 10-12 mRad/day (approximately 150 times higher than exposure on the surface of the Earth (<link linkend="bib92">Ohnishi and Ohnishi 2004</link><!--: PMID 15858386-->)), no significant differences in mutation rates were detected over an 11-day period (<link linkend="bib128">Zhao et al., 2006</link><!--: PMID 16765996-->), suggesting that DNA repair mechanisms must correct most mutations efficiently, and that spontaneous alterations to the genome may largely result from cell-intrinsic errors.</para>
<para>Mutations are important tools for gene function discovery. Forward and reverse genetic strategies rely on mutations to identify and characterize genes involved in a biological process of interest. A causal connection between mutation and phenotype can suggest mechanisms of wild-type gene action and can be used for diagnostic prediction. While gene function can be interrogated through targeted knockdown of RNAs using RNA interference (RNAi) (<link linkend="bib38">Fire et al., 1998</link><!--: PMID 9486653-->), identification of genomic lesions in genes has several advantages. For example, the functions of genes that are not susceptible to RNAi can be assessed. Special alleles of genes whose inactivation leads to lethality, or that function redundantly, can also be identified (<link linkend="bib90">Muller 1932</link>). Temperature sensitive alleles allow for temporal assessment of gene activity (<link linkend="bib50">Hartwell et al., 1974</link><!--: PMID 4587263-->), and single-gene mutations defining an allelic series can be used to study protein structure-function relationships (<link linkend="bib58">Jorgensen and Mango 2002</link><!--: PMID 11988761-->). Finally, while RNAi experiments sometimes give variable results (<link linkend="bib61">Kamath and Ahringer 2003</link><!--: PMID 12828945-->), genomic lesions tend to produce consistent phenotypic changes more suitable for quantitative analysis.</para>
<para>For spontaneous mutations to be an effective tool, roughly 1/(mutation rate) organisms must be screened to identify lesions in a particular gene. Often, one must screen well above this number. Although this is easily achieved in bacteria or yeast, the number is prohibitively high for other organisms, including <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. Fortunately, the work of <link linkend="bib89">Muller (1927)</link> demonstrated that mutation rates can be artificially enhanced by a variety of genotoxic agents (<link linkend="bib89">Muller 1927</link><!--: PMID 17802387-->). Practically, such treatments must maintain a balance between administration of sufficient damage (to reduce the numbers of queried animals) and animal lethality/sterility. In <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, typical mutagenesis compatible with this balance inflicts 10<superscript>&minus;3</superscript> to 10<superscript>&minus;4</superscript> mutations per gene per generation (<link linkend="bib44">Gengyo-Ando and Mitani 2000</link><!--: PMID 10694478-->).</para>
<para>This chapter provides an overview of historical and current methods for gene mutagenesis in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>. Three mutagenesis strategies are commonly used: genome-wide mutagenesis, in which unknown genes controlling a biological process are sought (forward genetics); target-selected mutagenesis, in which the entire genome is mutagenized but mutations in a known single gene are screened (reverse genetics); and gene-targeted mutagenesis, in which only a single gene is targeted for mutagenesis (reverse genetics). Method rationales and protocols are outlined, and are meant to serve as an introduction to aid researchers in identifying mutagenesis methods suitable to their goals (<link linkend="table1">Table 1</link>). Detailed protocols for each method are not presented for most methods, but are referenced and should be carefully followed when implemented in the laboratory.</para>

<title>Genome-wide mutagenesis</title>
<para>Non-directed genome-wide mutagenesis is commonly used for forward genetic screens, where mutants defective in a biological process of interest are sought. Mutagenesis can be accomplished with a variety of chemical agents, each offering a specific array of favored lesions and mutation frequencies. Ionizing radiation mutagenesis is used to generate large deletions or complex rearrangements. Alternatively, mutagenesis is achieved with transposon insertion, using either the endogenous transposons already present in the nematode or an exogenous <emphasis>Mos1</emphasis> transposon.</para>
<sect2 id="sec2-1">
<title>Strategies for forward genetic screens</title>
<para>Prior to embarking on genome-wide mutagenesis, a screen must be designed to identify mutant animals defective in the biological process under study. A thorough review of the various types of genetic screens in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> has been previously published and should be consulted (<link linkend="bib58">Jorgensen and Mango 2002</link><!--: PMID 11988761-->). The most common screen involves identifying recessive mutations exposed in second-generation (F2) animals of a mutagenized parental strain (P0, <link linkend="figure1">Figure 1</link>). Typically, P0 hermaphrodites are mutagenized at the late L4 or early adult stages. F1 progeny, heterozygous for many induced mutations, are then allowed to self, and F2 animals are screened for the phenotype of interest. Many variations on this screen exist, and each screen should be carefully constructed to find enough mutants for the phenotype of interest (<link linkend="bib58">Jorgensen and Mango 2002</link><!--: PMID 11988761-->). Because some genetic screens can be demanding in effort and time, it is prudent to optimize the ratio of F2-to-F1 animals assayed (<link linkend="bib105">Shaham 2007</link><!--: PMID 17989770-->). Calculations for the amount of effort required per screen center on whether F1 or F2 animals must be plated individually. We previously set up a web calculator to aid in evaluating optimal screen parameters (<ulink url="http://shahamlab.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin/Genetic_screens/screenfrontpage.cgi">http://shahamlab.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin/Genetic_screens/screenfrontpage.cgi</ulink>). A detailed description of the theoretical considerations behind this calculator is available (<link linkend="bib105">Shaham 2007</link><!--: PMID 17989770-->). There are also techniques to automate and expedite a forward genetic screen, including the Complex Object Parametric Analyzer and Sorter (COPAS&trade;), a device that sorts animals into individual wells, and microfluidic devices coupled to automated imaging (<link linkend="bib20">Chung et al., 2008</link><!--: PMID 18568029-->; <link linkend="bib28">Crane et al., 2012</link><!--: PMID 22902935-->; <link linkend="bib33">Doitsidou et al., 2008</link><!--: PMID 18758453-->).</para>

<para>Once a mutant is identified, several strategies can be used to isolate the affected gene. In the past, two- and three-point mapping with genetic markers was used to identify the affected region, although this method is not commonly employed today (for a review, see WormBook chapter <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_twopointmapmarkers.2/twopointmapmarkers.html">Genetic mapping and manipulation: Chapter 2-Two-point mapping with genetic markers)</ulink>. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping using the polymorphic Hawaiian isolate CB4856 is a more common approach (<link linkend="bib122">Wicks et al., 2001</link><!--: PMID 11381264-->). Oligonucleotide array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) has also been used successfully to identify point mutations and deletions in complex pools of genomic DNA (<link linkend="bib77">Maydan et al., 2007</link><!--: PMID 17267812-->; <link linkend="bib78">Maydan et al., 2009</link><!--: PMID 19189945-->). In this case, custom-made arrays with overlapping 50-mer probes are used to identify SNPs and insertions or deletions (indels). Whole-genome sequencing is now a cost-effective approach to gene mapping, and it can be combined with other mapping methods for rapid gene identification (<link linkend="bib34">Doitsidou et al., 2010</link><!--: PMID 21079745-->; <link linkend="bib102">Sarin et al., 2008</link><!--: PMID 18677319-->; <link linkend="bib129">Zuryn et al., 2010</link><!--: PMID 20610404-->). There is open-source software to aid in whole-genome sequencing data analysis and mutant identification, including Bowtie, CloudMap, and galign, which are specifically tailored to the <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> genome (<link linkend="bib67">Langmead et al., 2009</link><!--: PMID 19261174-->; <link linkend="bib66">Langmead and Salzberg 2012</link><!--: PMID 22388286-->; <link linkend="bib82">Minevich et al., 2012</link><!--: PMID 23051646-->; <link linkend="bib106">Shaham 2009</link><!--: PMID 19779626-->).</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sec2-2">
<title>Chemical mutagenesis</title>
<para>Chemical mutagenesis provides the easiest and most straightforward way to induce germline mutations at high frequency. Mutation prevalence using chemicals is high enough that a relatively low number of haploid genomes must be interrogated to reach saturation. The most widely used mutagens in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> are ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and trimethylpsoralen with ultraviolet light (UV/TMP). There are, however, many others with differing mutagenic spectra, including N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), formaldehyde, nitrosoguanidine (NTG), diethyl sulfate (DES), acetaldehyde, diepoxybutane (DEB) and diepoxyoctane (DEO). A cocktail of EMS/ENU has also been used to induce a spectrum of mutations (<link linkend="bib111">Thompson et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23800452-->). Special care should be taken when handling mutagens: working in a chemical hood and wearing proper personal protection gear are a must. Consult the relevant Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and your chemical waste department before beginning a chemical genetic screen.</para>
<sect3 id="sec2-2-1">
<title>Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)</title>
<para>EMS is the most commonly used mutagen in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> and by far the most potent (<link linkend="bib15">Brenner 1974</link><!--: PMID 4366476-->; <link linkend="bib39">Flibotte et al., 2010</link><!--: PMID 20439774-->). A forward mutation rate as high as 2.5&times;10<superscript>&minus;3</superscript> mutations/gene/generation can be achieved with acceptable rates of sterility (<link linkend="bib44">Gengyo-Ando and Mitani 2000</link><!--: PMID 10694478-->). EMS is an alkylating agent and most commonly adds an ethyl group to guanine to form O<superscript>6</superscript>-ethylguanine (<link linkend="bib16">Brookes and Lawley 1961</link><!--: PMID 16748923-->). This modified guanine pairs inappropriately with thymine in subsequent replications (<link linkend="bib27">Coulondre and Miller 1977</link><!--: PMID 609095-->). Therefore, mutagenesis is biased towards G/C to A/T transitions, respectively, which often leads to the generation of stop codons (<link linkend="bib39">Flibotte et al., 2010</link><!--: PMID 20439774-->). Therefore, these mutations are typically strong loss-of-function or null alleles. Roughly 13% of EMS lesions are deletions or other chromosomal rearrangements (<link linkend="bib2">Anderson 1995</link><!--: PMID 8531732-->).</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis>Protocol</emphasis></emphasis> (<link linkend="bib15">Brenner 1974</link><!--: PMID 4366476-->):</para>
<para>Synchronized L4 or young-adult hermaphrodites are washed with M9 buffer in a sterile 15 ml plastic tube. Spin down animals at 700 &times; <emphasis>g</emphasis> for 1 min and remove supernatant. Wash animals at least 3x to remove bacteria. Resuspend animals in 2 ml M9. Add 2 ml of a 2x stock solution of EMS (100 mM). Animals are incubated in a total volume of 4 ml of 50 mM EMS in M9 for 4 h at 20 <superscript>o</superscript>C with constant rotation. EMS should be prepared immediately before use. Animals are then washed 5x with 15 ml M9 to remove trace EMS. For standard F2 screens, plate mutagenized animals using a glass pipette on large NGM plates until F1 animals are gravid. Bleach F1 animals, and plate F2 eggs on NGM plates. Score for the defects of interest at the appropriate developmental stage. EMS is detoxified by addition of 1 M NaOH.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec2-2-2">
<title>Trimethylpsoralen (TMP)</title>
<para>TMP is a light-sensitive interstrand cross-linking agent, whose mutagenicity is enhanced in the presence of long-wave UV light (<link linkend="bib22">Cole 1970</link><!--: PMID 4927248-->). UV/TMP generates small deletions with an average size of one to three kilobases; however, all base transitions and transversions have been observed experimentally (<link linkend="bib39">Flibotte et al., 2010</link><!--: PMID 20439774-->; <link linkend="bib44">Gengyo-Ando and Mitani 2000</link><!--: PMID 10694478-->; <link linkend="bib126">Yandell et al., 1994</link><!--: PMID 7906415-->). The forward mutation rate is approximately 1 &times; 10<superscript>&minus;3</superscript> mutations/gene/generation, but depends on total UV exposure (<link linkend="bib44">Gengyo-Ando and Mitani 2000</link><!--: PMID 10694478-->).</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis>Protocol</emphasis></emphasis> (<link linkend="bib8">Barstead and Moerman 2006</link><!--: PMID 16988425-->):</para>
<para>Synchronized L4 animals are washed 5x in 15 ml M9 to remove bacteria. Animals are then resuspended in 580 &micro;l M9 buffer. Twenty microliters of freshly made TMP (1 mg/ml in DMSO) is added to the culture, and animals are incubated in the dark for 15 min. Pipette animals onto dry, unseeded, 9 cm NGM plates. Remove plate lids, and apply 360 &micro;J UV light. A Stratalinker<superscript>&reg;</superscript> UV Crosslinker (Stratagene) is useful for this step, but calibrated hand-held UV lamps can be used as well (<link linkend="bib126">Yandell et al., 1994</link><!--: PMID 7906415-->). Next, add OP50 directly on top of the mutagenized worms and recover for 5 h in the dark at 20 <superscript>o</superscript>C. Continue as for EMS screens. A range of final concentrations of TMP (2 &micro;g/ml to 30 &micro;g/ml) is reported to be successful. It is likely that variations depend on total UV exposure and variability between batches of TMP. Dose-response curves can be used to optimize mutagenesis for each batch (<link linkend="bib8">Barstead and Moerman 2006</link><!--: PMID 16988425-->).</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sec2-2-3">
<title>N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)</title>
<para>ENU generates an array of molecular lesions, and it is therefore the mutagen of choice if allelic variability is important (<link linkend="bib39">Flibotte et al., 2010</link><!--: PMID 20439774-->). The mutagenicity of ENU occurs by transferring its ethyl moiety to nitrogen or oxygen on any of the four nucleotides, creating modified DNA bases that later hinder proper replication (<link linkend="bib47">Goth and Rajewsky 1972</link><!--: PMID 5063976-->; <link linkend="bib59">Justice et al., 1999</link><!--: PMID 10469849-->). All codons are equally mutable with ENU, so non-null alleles are often generated (<link linkend="bib29">De Stasio and Dorman 2001</link><!--: PMID 11448645-->).

The reversion frequency is the frequency at which a mutated phenotype reverts back to wild type. This is commonly a result of a second site suppressor mutation.

<title>Non-directed insertional mutagenesis using transposons</title>

In <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, there are six active endogenous transposons, Tc1-Tc5 and Tc7 (<link linkend="bib23">Collins and Anderson 1994</link><!--: PMID 8088523-->; <link linkend="bib24">Collins et al., 1989</link><!--: PMID 2537252-->; <link linkend="bib36">Emmons et al., 1983</link><!--: PMID 6297788-->; <link linkend="bib70">Levitt and Emmons 1989</link><!--: PMID 2541437-->; <link linkend="bib71">Liao et al., 1983</link><!--: PMID 6304721-->; <link linkend="bib97">Rezsohazy et al., 1997</link><!--: PMID 9321656-->; <link linkend="bib127">Yuan et al., 1991</link><!--: PMID 1849651-->). Tc1 is the most enriched transposon in the N2 strain, with approximately 30 copies (<link linkend="bib36">Emmons et al., 1983</link><!--: PMID 6297788-->). Transposons are not normally active in the germline of N2, but they may become active when genes regulating RNAi and transposition are mutated (<link linkend="bib25">Collins et al., 1987</link><!--: PMID 3039378-->; <link linkend="bib118">Vastenhouw et al., 2003</link><!--: PMID 12906791-->).

Endogenous transposons and <emphasis>Mos1</emphasis> insert randomly into the genome when activated in the appropriate background. Importantly, after insertion and following back-crossing, the transposon provides a molecular tag by which the disrupted gene can be identified using inverse (vectorette) PCR or whole-genome sequencing (<link linkend="figure2">Figure 2</link>) (<link linkend="bib108">Smith 2011</link><!--: PMID 21486250-->; <link linkend="bib124">Williams et al., 2005</link><!--: PMID 15654093-->).

<para>While generating mutations by chemical or radiation-induced mutagenesis is simple, identification of the relevant molecular lesion may not be. Major advances in SNP mapping and whole genome sequencing have made gene identification easier, yet these methods can be time consuming and labor intensive. This is especially the case when weakly penetrant or behavioral mutants are studied. In both cases, phenotype can only be established by scoring populations of animals, often requiring F3 or F4 animals to be evaluated. In these cases, non-directed insertional mutagenesis using transposons becomes a useful alternative.</para>
<para>There are several caveats to consider before performing a genome-wide screen using insertional mutagenesis. The Bristol reference strain N2 has 30 copies of Tc1 already present in the background, complicating identification of the causal lesion (<link linkend="bib36">Emmons et al., 1983</link><!--: PMID 6297788-->). Both Tc1 and <emphasis>Mos1</emphasis> have a bias for TA insertion sites; this makes transposons prone to inserting into introns, which may not inactivate the nearby gene or may be spliced out during transcription (<link linkend="bib48">Granger et al., 2004</link><!--: PMID 15310838-->; <link linkend="bib85">Mori et al., 1988</link><!--: PMID 2829205-->; <link linkend="bib101">Rushforth and Anderson 1996</link><!--: PMID 8524324-->). <emphasis>Mos1</emphasis> has about a 10x lower mutation rate than EMS, meaning that ten times as many animals need to be scored to identify a phenotype of interest (<link linkend="bib124">Williams et al., 2005</link><!--: PMID 15654093-->). Some mutations also occur as a result of &lsquo;hit-and-run&rsquo; events, where transposon insertion and subsequent removal causes small indels to disrupt a gene (<link linkend="bib14">Boulin and Bessereau 2007</link><!--: PMID 17546024-->; <link linkend="bib124">Williams et al., 2005</link><!--: PMID 15654093-->). These events greatly complicate gene identification. Because of these disadvantages, transposon-based insertional mutagenesis screening is used less often. <emphasis>Mos1-</emphasis>based methods are preferred. There are Tc1-derived alleles available from the CGC, so the descriptions below provide an overview of how those alleles were obtained.</para>

<title>Tc1-mediated transposition</title>
<para><emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> strains carry endogenous transposons, which have been used to perform a whole-genome insertional mutagenesis screen. Of the six endogenous, active transposons, Tc1 and Tc3 are screened most often, as these have the highest copy number in N2. All transposons, however, are active in most mutator backgrounds (<link linkend="bib76">Martin et al., 2002</link><!--: PMID 12242258-->). Tc1 uses TA as an integration site, but with a relaxed target site specificity (<link linkend="bib85">Mori et al., 1988</link><!--: PMID 2829205-->).</para>

Because these mutator strains have high rates of transposon hopping, they tend to accumulate mutations quickly, and they should be freshly thawed from frozen stocks rather than propagated on plates (<link linkend="bib2">Anderson 1995</link><!--: PMID 8531732-->).</para>

<para>Prior to screening, a mutator strain is backcrossed four times to the strain that will be mutagenized. Outcrossing limits the number of Tc1 copies already present in the mutator strain and removes any extraneous mutations prior to screening. Animals are allowed to grow for ten generations to accumulate mutations and are then screened for defects of interest (<link linkend="bib76">Martin et al., 2002</link><!--: PMID 12242258-->). Once the phenotype is confirmed, strains are immediately outcrossed to the parental strain. This removes the mutator locus and prevents transposon excision from the gene of interest. Transposon insertion sites are identified similar to <emphasis>Mos1</emphasis> identification below<emphasis>.</emphasis> Since there are multiple copies of Tc1 in the background, SNP mapping is helpful in determining the chromosome of interest and reducing the possible number of candidate genes. As is the case for <emphasis>Mos1</emphasis>, most insertions occur in intergenic regions and introns, but a small percentage also appear in exons (<link linkend="bib117">van der Linden and Plasterk 2004</link><!--: PMID 18629154-->).</para>

Mutagenesis rates are an order of magnitude lower than chemical mutagenesis. As a result, ten times as many F1 animals must be screened to identify lesions in a given gene (<link linkend="bib124">Williams et al., 2005</link><!--: PMID 15654093-->).

Deletion strains are listed on <ulink url="http://www.wormbase.org/">Wormbase</ulink>, which should be consulted first to determine if an allele is already available for a gene of interest. If not, one may request a deletion strain from the Consortium. Upon receiving a strain, it should be outcrossed to remove irrelevant mutations. It is always important to verify the presence of the mutation in a strain. In addition, deletion mutations obtained by target-selection can be accompanied by proximal duplications, resulting in obligate heterozygosity for the gene under consideration. In these situations, phenotypic assessment of the mutant strain may not reveal the defects associated with complete gene loss. To confirm that a gene of interest is responsible for an observed defect, transgenic rescue experiments should be performed and/or multiple alleles examined ( <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> <link linkend="bib17">Deletion Mutant Consortium 2012</link><!--: PMID 23173093-->).

For library construction, 600,000 hermaphrodites are randomly mutagenized. Once the mutagenized animals become gravid, they are bleached and L1s are allowed to hatch in M9, overnight. The L1s are then subdivided into 1,152 subcultures (55 mm NGM plates) of 500 animals each. After two generations of self-fertilization, 20% of the animals per plate are rinsed off for genomic DNA isolation into twelve 96-well plates (<link linkend="bib69">Lesa 2006</link><!--: PMID 17406462-->). The remaining animals are stored at 15&deg;C for up to six weeks. Although libraries can be frozen, live-animal libraries are less prone to failures in mutant recovery (<link linkend="bib69">Lesa 2006</link><!--: PMID 17406462-->).</para>
<para>Three approaches are commonly used to search for deletions in a gene of interest: restricted PCR conditions, poison primers, and thermostable restriction enzymes. Each approach employs nested PCR primers designed to flank the genomic sequence of interest to increase specificity, and each method favors amplification of deletion products over larger wild-type products (<link linkend="bib35">Edgley et al., 2002</link><!--: PMID 12060690-->; <link linkend="bib54">Jansen et al., 1997</link><!--: PMID 9288111-->; <link linkend="bib121">Wei et al., 2002</link><!--: PMID 12384612-->; <link linkend="bib130">Zwaal et al., 1993</link><!--: PMID 8395047-->). All of these methods are prone to high false positive rates (50%-90%); therefore, each pooled sample should be screened in duplicate (<link linkend="bib54">Jansen et al., 1997</link><!--: PMID 9288111-->). A comprehensive protocol for library creation and the poison primer PCR technique is available in the <ulink url="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_introreversegenetics/introreversegenetics.html">Reverse genetics</ulink> chapter in WormBook.</para>

<title>Restricted PCR extension time (<link linkend="bib54">Jansen et al., 1997</link><!--: PMID 9288111-->)</title>
<para>Each library pool is incubated first with a primer pair (10 pmol per primer) designed 2.5-3.5 kb apart over a region of interest, followed by incubation of a 1:500 dilution of the first PCR with a nested primer pair (<link linkend="bib73">Liu et al., 1999</link><!--: PMID 10508845-->). After addition of polymerase, nucleotides and buffer, samples are cycled with short extension times (45 s to 1 min) to favor accumulation of the deletion product (<link linkend="bib54">Jansen et al., 1997</link><!--: PMID 9288111-->). DNA polymerases have specific turnover rates (maximum number of nucleotides polymerized in a given amount of time), which vary depending on the type of Taq used (<link linkend="bib64">Kornberg and Baker 1992</link>). For example, if the wild-type (WT) product is 2 kb, the deletion product is 500 bp, and the Taq polymerase has a turnover rate of 1 kb/min, approximately two min will be needed to complete the WT reaction and 30 sec for the deletion product. If the extension time is limited to 45 s, only the deletion product will be amplified. Over many rounds, some WT product is amplified, but at a much slower rate than the deletion. This greatly increases the odds of detecting the less abundant deletion allele. Detected deletions are variable in extent and average around 1.4 kb in size (<link linkend="bib73">Liu et al., 1999</link><!--: PMID 10508845-->). Completed reactions are run on an agarose gel, and pools that have a product smaller than the wild-type product are identified. Library animals from this pool are plated either singly or in smaller pools and retested to identify single hermaphrodites carrying the relevant lesion (<link linkend="bib54">Jansen et al., 1997</link><!--: PMID 9288111-->).</para>

<title>Poison primer method (<link linkend="bib35">Edgley et al., 2002</link><!--: PMID 12060690-->)</title>
<para>This approach was developed to enrich for deletions that are less than 500 bp in size (<link linkend="bib35">Edgley et al., 2002</link><!--: PMID 12060690-->). The protocol is similar to that for the restricted PCR extension time method, except that a third primer is added between the external primers of the first PCR (<link linkend="figure3">Figure 3</link>). This poison primer is designed to amplify only off of wild-type genomic DNA, competing with the full-length wild-type product, thereby reducing the quantity of wild-type template available for the second PCR. The second set of nested primers is only able to bind the deleted product and the full-length wild-type product, whose total concentration is halved because of the poison primer product. This leads to a 500-fold increase in sensitivity by enhancing the ratio of deletion to wild-type products. Use of a short extension time (45 s) also facilitates synthesis of the deletion product. Because the poison primer determines the location of amplified deletion products, it is usually best to target the 5&rsquo; end of a gene to generate null alleles (<link linkend="bib35">Edgley et al., 2002</link><!--: PMID 12060690-->).</para>

PCR targeting a gene of interest is performed on genomic DNA derived from many pools of animals (<link linkend="figure4">Figure 4</link>). Primers are tagged with different fluorophores, marking the 5&rsquo; and 3&rsquo; ends of the product with different colors. After PCR, the DNA in each reaction is denatured. Reannealing then allows heteroduplex formation between wild-type and mutant DNA.

Tc1-based methods require that a transposon is located near or in the gene of interest. Once such a strain is identified, one can either screen for excision events that remove part of the gene, or introduce a mutated transgene to direct gene conversion.</para>

<para>For isolating deletion events, animals containing a Tc1 insertion in the gene of interest are crossed into a mutator background (<emphasis>e.g.,</emphasis> <emphasis>mut-2</emphasis>), and at least 100 animals are individually plated and allowed to self for two to three generations (<link linkend="bib130">Zwaal et al., 1993</link><!--: PMID 8395047-->). Half of the animals on each plate are washed off for DNA isolation, and screened for deletions using PCR. If a deletion is detected, individual animals from the remaining half are plated individually and assayed for the presence of the deletion. Typical excision rates are 10<superscript>&minus;3</superscript> per gene per generation (<link linkend="bib60">Kagan et al., 1997</link><!--: PMID 9434744-->).

<para>TALENs function like ZFNs, except that tandem TAL domains are fused to a <emphasis>Fok</emphasis>I protein (<link linkend="figure6">Figure 6B</link>). TAL domains allow a much greater freedom in choosing a DNA sequence to target (<link linkend="bib81">Miller et al., 2011</link><!--: PMID 21179091-->). Each domain is tailored to a specific nucleotide, rather than a tri-nucleotide sequence. The TAL code is modular (<link linkend="bib13">Boch et al., 2009</link><!--: PMID 19933107-->; <link linkend="bib88">Moscou and Bogdanove 2009</link><!--: PMID 19933106-->), allowing targeted nucleases to be generated at lower cost. Recently, an improvement to the system has been reported by fusing a single TAL domain to the catalytic domain of an I-TevI homing endonuclease, allowing the enzyme to function as a monomer (<link linkend="bib12">Beurdeley et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23612303-->). Although not yet used in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, it may allow TALEN mRNA to be injected at lower concentrations and be more effective (see Protocol below).</para>
<para>In prokaryotes, the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) system is an adaptive immune response against viruses and plasmids (reviewed in <link linkend="bib123">Wiedenheft et al., 2012</link><!--: PMID 22337052-->). The cell uses an RNA guide to cleave foreign DNA sequences (<link linkend="figure6">Figure 6C</link>). The minimum components required to obtain cleavage <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> for the Type II CRISPR system are the Cas9 nuclease from <emphasis>Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis> and a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) composed of a short CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) (<link linkend="bib56">Jinek et al., 2012</link><!--: PMID 22745249-->). Genomic specificity is provided by a 20-bp sequence within the crRNA, whose only constraint is the trinucleotide NGG (protospacer-adjacent motif or PAM) after the 3&rsquo; end of the sequence. In genomic editing, after successful targeting by the sgRNA, Cas9 introduces a double-strand break, which may introduce indels after error-prone repair; alternately, Cas9 can be converted into a nickase by a single amino acid substitution, which then promotes homology-directed repair off a transgene (<link linkend="bib26">Cong et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23287718-->; <link linkend="bib75">Mali et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23287722-->). Because of the small size of the targeting constructs, multiple loci can be edited at once (<link linkend="bib26">Cong et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23287718-->). Thus far, no off-target effects have been detected, although thorough whole genome analysis is still needed (<link linkend="bib19">Cho et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23360966-->; <link linkend="bib120">Wang et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23643243-->). As of writing, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used successfully to introduce changes to specific genomic loci in bacteria (<link linkend="bib55">Jiang et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23360965-->), yeast (<link linkend="bib32">Dicarlo et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23460208-->), zebrafish (<link linkend="bib18">Chang et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23528705-->; <link linkend="bib52">Hwang et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23360964-->), mice (<link linkend="bib120">Wang et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23643243-->), and human cells (<link linkend="bib19">Cho et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23360966-->; <link linkend="bib26">Cong et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23287718-->; <link linkend="bib75">Mali et al., 2013</link><!--: PMID 23287722-->).</para>
<para>When ZFNs and TALENs were initially tried in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, germline cleavage was difficult to obtain: ZFN-directed cleavage only occurred in somatic cells (<link linkend="bib87">Morton et al., 2006</link><!--: PMID 17060623-->). However, a recently developed protocol uses mRNA constructs for injection into the germ line, and heritable gene changes occur in approximately 5% of progeny (<link linkend="bib125">Wood et al., 2011</link><!--: PMID 21700836-->). While only a few studies have used ZFNs and TALENs to generate targeted deletions, these new protocol adjustments greatly improve efficiency. Help designing chimeric proteins can be found at <ulink url="http://www.zincfingers.org/">http://www.zincfingers.org/</ulink> for ZFNs and at <ulink url="https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu/">tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu</ulink> for TALENs. While the CRISPR system in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> has not yet been published, its utility in genomic editing in other model organisms and mammalian cell culture provide promise that the system will be easily and inexpensively applied to <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis> and other nematodes in the near future.</para>

<para>ZFN or TALEN mRNAs that target a gene of interest are injected at low pressure directly into the hermaphrodite gonad (<link linkend="bib125">Wood et al., 2011</link><!--: PMID 21700836-->). The mRNAs have 5&rsquo; and 3&rsquo; UTRs to increase germ line translation efficacy, as well as a 5&rsquo; cap and a 3&rsquo; polyA tail. ZFN mRNAs are injected at 250 ng/&micro;l per construct (total concentration is 500 ng/&micro;l). TALENs are injected at 1500 ng/&micro;l per construct. F1 animals with the highest likelihood of changes in a target gene arise 10-14 h after injection, with 3.5%-5% of the progeny acquiring a small indel during this 4 h period. F2 animals derived from these F1 animals are screened either by phenotype or by PCR (<link linkend="bib125">Wood et al., 2011</link><!--: PMID 21700836-->).</para>

<title>Summary</title>
<para>An array of random and directed genome alteration methods are available in <emphasis>C. elegans</emphasis>, and the choice of which method to use largely depends on the biological problem at hand. Chemical mutagenesis is generally useful for defining genes associated with a particular biological process, as are methods involving random generation of deletions and transposon insertions. Reverse genetic methods are utilized when the functions of specific genes are sought. Because all of the methods described here rely on random processes for mutation generation, screening of large numbers of animals is generally unavoidable. Thus, before embarking on mutagenesis, care should be taken to optimize screen design. Finally, it is imperative that the assignment of phenotype to gene be rigorously demonstrated. A good rule to follow is that two independent assays should corroborate an assignment. For example, rescue studies and allele identification, multiple alleles, or RNAi and allele isolation are all reasonable combinations confirming gene assignment.</para>
