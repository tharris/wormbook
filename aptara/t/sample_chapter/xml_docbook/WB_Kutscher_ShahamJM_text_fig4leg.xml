<title>Figure 4. TILLING allows identification of point mutations in pools of mutated DNA.</title>
<para>Both mutated DNA and wild-type DNA are subjected to PCR, using differentially labeled 5&rsquo; and 3&rsquo; primers (here in green and red). The PCR products are denatured and reannealed slowly, so that heteroduplex DNA forms between a mutated DNA strand and a wild-type DNA strand. The reannealed PCR products are treated with Cel1, an enzyme that specifically cleaves heteroduplex DNA. The reaction is visualized on a LI-COR gel in two fluorescence channels. When heteroduplex DNA is cut, smaller DNA fragments are seen in both the green and red channels within the same lane. Full-length, uncut product will be prominent at the top of the gel.</para>
