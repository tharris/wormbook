<title>Figure 1. A simple F2 screen.</title>
<para>Depicted here is the simplest variation of an F2 screen, which involves isolating mutants with a phenotype of interest in the second generation after mutagenesis. A population of young L4 hermaphrodites is mutagenized. F1 animals are collected, and F2 single hermaphrodites are isolated, carrying a homozygous mutation in a gene of interest. Obtaining a mutation is a rare event. The details of the scheme depend on the type of mutation sought. For a detailed description of different varieties of F2 screens, consult <link linkend="bib58">Jorgensen and Mango (2002)</link><!--: PMID 11988761-->.</para>
