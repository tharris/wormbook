MM Forms is not just another contact form plugin!

== Description ==

<strong>MM Forms is the easy form builder for Wordpress.<br />
Easy, yet not simple.</strong>

MM Forms  comes with the power of a tank, but drives like a bike.<br />
Anyone who has the knowledge to connect to the internet will be able to create web forms with MM Forms.
Sounds easy, right?

But it ain't simple!

MM Forms has some basic features like :<br />
<ul>
<li>field creator</li>
<li>customize form and mail contents with simple markup</li>
<li>html layout possible</li>
<li>Spam filtering with Akismet</li>
<li>captcha prevention</li>
<li>multiple, not to say unlimited contact forms</li>
</ul>

But offcourse it also kicks some ass with the following cunning features : <br />
<ul>
<li>automatic thank you e-mail after a submission</li>
<li>Save form submissions to database</li>
<li>Export to CSV of submissions</li>
<li>RSS feed of form submissions</li>
<li>Send HTML formatted emails</li>
<li>Easy insert forms in posts/pages via TinyMCE button</li>
<li>Add your own customized HTML form code instead of using the build-in field creator, giving you more flexibility and control on form behaviour</li>
</ul>
